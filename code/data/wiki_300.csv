214730,Henry Hallam,"Henry Hallam (July 9, 1777 - January 21, 1859) was an  English historian.



The only son of John Hallam, canon of Windsor and dean of Bristol, he was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1799. Called to the bar, he practised for some years on the Oxford circuit; but his tastes were literary, and when, on his father's death in 1812, he inherited a small estate in Lincolnshire, he gave himself up wholly to academic study. He had become connected with the brilliant band of authors and politicians who led the Whig party, a connection to which he owed his appointment to the well-paid and easy post of commissioner of stamps; but took no part in politics himself.  He was, however, an active supporter of many popular movements--particularly of that which ended in the abolition of the slave trade; and he was sincerely attached to the political principles of the Whigs. 



Hallam's earliest literary work was undertaken in connexion with the great organ of the Whig party, the Edinburgh Review, where his review of Scott's Dryden attracted attention. His first great work, The View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages, was produced in 1818, and was followed nine years later by the Constitutional History of England. In 1838-1839 appeared the Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries.  These are the three works on which Hallam's fame rests. They took a place in English literature which was not seriously challenged until the 20th century. A volume of supplemental notes to his Middle Ages was published in 1848; these facts and dates represent nearly all of Hallam's career. The strongest personal interest in his life was the affliction which befell him in the loss of his children, one after another. His eldest son, Arthur Henry Hallam--the ""A.H.H."" of Tennyson's In Memoriam, and by the testimony of his contemporaries a man of the most brilliant promise--died in 1833 at the age of twenty-two. Seventeen years later, his second son, Henry Fitzmaurice Hallam, was cut off like his brother at the very threshold of what might have been a great career. The premature death and high talents of these young men, and the association of one of them with the most popular poem of the age, have made Hallam's family afflictions better known than any other incidents of his life. He survived wife, daughter and sons by many years.



In 1834 Hallam published The Remains in Prose and Verse of Arthur Henry Hallam, with a Sketch of his Life. In 1852 a selection of Literary Essays and Characters from the Literature of Europe was published. Hallam was a fellow of the Royal Society, and a trustee of the British Museum, and enjoyed many other appropriate distinctions. In 1830 he received the gold medal for history, founded by George IV.  The Middle Ages is described by Hallam himself as a series of historical dissertations, a comprehensive survey of the chief circumstances that can interest a philosophical inquirer during the period from the 5th to the 15th century. The work consists of nine long chapters, each of which is a complete treatise in itself. The history of France, of Italy, of Spain, of Germany, and of the Greek and Saracenic empires, sketched in rapid and general terms, is the subject of five separate chapters. Others deal with the great institutional features of medieval society--the development of the feudal system, of the ecclesiastical system, and of the free political system of England. The last chapter sketches the general state of society, the growth of commerce, manners, and literature in the Middle Ages. The book may be regarded as a general view of early modern history, preparatory to the more detailed treatment of special lines of inquiry carried out in his subsequent works, although Hallam's original intention was to continue the work on the scale on which it had been begun. 



The Constitutional History of England takes up the subject at the point at which it had been dropped in the View of the Middle Ages, viz, the accession of Henry VII, and carries it down to the accession of George III. Hallam stopped here for a characteristic reason, which it is impossible not to respect and to regret. He was unwilling to excite the prejudices of modern politics which seemed to him to run back through the whole period of the reign of George III; nevertheless, he was accused of bias.  The Quarterly Review for 1828 contains an article on the Constitutional History, written by Southey, full of reproach. The work, he says. is the ""production of a decided partisan,"" who ""rakes in the ashes of long-forgotten and a thousand times buried slanders, for the means of heaping obloquy on all who supported the established institutions of the country."" Hallam's view of constitutional history was that it should contain only so much of the political and general history of the time as bears directly on specific changes in the organization of the state, including judicial as well as ecclesiastical institutions.  It was his cool treatment of such sanctified names as Charles I, Cranmer and Laud that provoked the indignation of Southey, who forgot that the same impartial measure was extended to statesmen on the other side.



If Hallam ever deviated from perfect fairness, it was in the tacit assumption that the 19th century theory of the constitution was the right theory in previous centuries, and that those who departed from it on one side or the other were in the wrong. He did unconsciously antedate the constitution, and it is clear from incidental allusions in his last work that he did not favour the democratic changes he thought to be impending. Hallam, like Macaulay, ultimately referred all political questions to the standard of Whig constitutionalism. But he was scrupulously conscientious in collecting and weighing his materials. In this he was helped by his legal training, and it was this which made the Constitutional History one of the standard text-books of English politics.



Like the Constitutional History, the Introduction to the Literature of Europe continues a branch of inquiry which had been opened in the View of the Middle Ages. In the first chapter of the Literature, which is to a great extent supplementary to the last chapter of the Middle Ages, Hallam sketches the state of literature in Europe down to the end of the 14th century: the extinction of ancient learning which followed the fall of the Roman empire and the rise of Christianity; the preservation of the Latin language in the services of the church; and the slow revival of letters, which began to show itself soon after the 7th century--""the nadir of the human mind""--had been passed. For the first century and a half of his special period he is mainly occupied with a review of classical learning, and he adopts the plan of taking short decennial periods and noticing the most remarkable works which they produced.  The rapid growth of literature in the 16th century compels him to resort to a classification of subjects: in the period 1520-1550 we have separate chapters on ancient literature, theology, speculative philosophy and jurisprudence, the literature of taste, and scientific and miscellaneous literature; and the subdivisions of subjects is carried further of course in the later periods. Thus poetry, the drama and polite literature form the subjects of separate chapters. One inconvenient result of this arrangement is that the same author is scattered over many chapters, according as his works fall within this category or that period of time. Names like Shakespeare, Grotius, Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes appear in half a dozen different places. The individuality of great authors is thus dissipated except when it has been preserved by an occasional sacrifice of the arrangement--and this defect, if it is to be esteemed a defect, is increased by the very sparing references to personal history and character with which Hallam was obliged to content himself.



His plan excluded biographical history, nor is the work, he tells us, to be regarded as one of reference. It is rigidly an account of the books which would make a complete library of the period, arranged according to the date of their publication and the nature of their subjects. The history of institutions like universities and academies, and that of great popular movements like the Reformation, are of course noticed in their immediate connection with literary results; but Hallam had little taste for the spacious generalization which such subjects suggest. The great qualities displayed in this work have been universally acknowledged--conscientiousness, accuracy, judgment and enormous reading. Not the least styiking testimony to Hallam's powers is his mastery over so many diverse forms of intellectual activity. In science and theology, mathematics and poetry, metaphysics and law, he is a competent and always a fair if not a profound critic. The bent of his own mind is manifest in his treatment of pure literature and of political speculation--which seems to be inspired with stronger personal interest and a higher sense of power than other parts of his work display. Not less worthy of notice in a literary history is the good sense by which both his learning and his tastes have been held in control. Probably no writer ever possessed a juster view of the relative importance of men and things. The labour devoted to an investigation is with Hallam no excuse for dwelling on the result, unless that is in itself important. He turns away contemptuously from the mere curiosities of literature, and is never tempted to make a display of trivial erudition. Nor do we find that his interest in special studies leads him to assign them a disproportionate place in his general view of the literature of a period.



Hallam is generally described as a ""philosophical historian."" The description is justified not so much by any philosophical quality in his method as by the nature of his subject and his own temper. Hallam is a philosopher to this extent that both in political and in literary history he fixed his attention on results rather than on persons. His conception of history embraced the whole movement of society. Beside that conception the issue of battles and the fate of kings fall into comparative insignificance. ""We can trace the pedigree of princes,"" he reflects, ""fill up the catalogue of towns besieged and provinces desolated, describe even the whole pageantry of coronations and festivals, but we cannot recover the genuine history of mankind."" But, on the other hand, there is no trace in Hallam of anything like a philosophy of history or society.



Wise and generally melancholy reflections on human nature and political society are not infrequent in his writings, and they arise naturally and incidentally out of the subject he is discussing. His object is the attainment of truth in matters of fact. Sweeping theories of the movement of society, and broad characterizations of particular periods of history seem to have no attraction for him.  The view of mankind on which such generalizations are usually based, taking little account of individual character, was distasteful to him. Thus he objects to the use of statistics because they favour the tendency to regard all men as mentally and morally equal. At the same time Hallam by no means assumes the tone of the mere scholar. He is solicitous to show that his point of view is that of the cultivated gentleman and not of the specialist. Thus he tells us that Montaigne is the first French author whom an English gentleman is ashamed not to have read. In fact, allusions to the necessary studies of a gentleman meet us constantly, reminding us of the unlikely erudition of the schoolboy in Macaulay. Hallam's prejudices, so far as he had any, belong to the same character. His criticism assumes a tone of moral censure when he has to deal with certain extremes of human thought--scepticism in philosophy, atheism in religion and democracy in politics.

2843783,3 Flies Up,"3 Flies Up is a simple variant of American football that is popular in schoolyards, and typically involves one 'flier' who throws the football to a group of catchers, each individually attempting to best each other and catch 'flies' (passes that have not hit the ground) out of the air for points. 



Once a single catcher catches three 'flies' (they do not usually need to be consecutive), he or she becomes the new flier, and a new game is played, in which the prior flier joins the rest of the catchers. This can go on for a long time, making 3 Flies Up a perpetual game that can be played indefinitely. In some versions, players make it ""interesting"" by playing until a specific moment or time, in which the current flier at the time is named champion.



Variations.

Another popular version of the game (different regions and schools play different ways) is called ""500"", and consists of the same basic principles, but with a different scoring system; The passer randomly calls out a number between 1 and 500 as he or she throws the ball to the cluster of catchers. If successfully received by a catcher, the designated amount of points is awarded, and a winner is declared once a score of '500' is reached. Many school teachers prefer this method, because it can require some basic arithmetic skills, which can be practiced through the physical activity."
9139633,Sterling College (Vermont),"Sterling College is a work college in Craftsbury Common, Vermont known as the smallest accredited four-year college in the country. The school is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Sterling is one of only two colleges in the United States to offer a degree in circumpolar studies.



History.

Sterling School was founded in 1958 as a boys' college preparatory school by former Berkshire School faculty member Norman Rioux. The school's educational philosophy was influenced by that of Outward Bound founder Kurt Hahn. The school transition to higher education during the 1970s began with the Academic Short Course in Outdoor Leadership, a 21-day program for 13 to 16 year olds. 



Faced with closure in 1974, a group of faculty chose to remain and established an academic year-long program similar to Outward Bound programs known as Grassroots Project in Vermont at Sterling Institute. By 1983, Sterling had developed into an accredited college offering an Associate of Arts degree in resource management with full accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges granted in 1987. 



Since 1997, Sterling College has been accredited as a four-year college and has awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree with concentrations in wildlands ecology and management, outdoor education and leadership, and sustainable agriculture. The four-year program builds on the Grassroots Year and second-year internship program from the  two-year program with a junior year in which many students engage in field studies abroad and a comprehensive Senior Applied Research Project. Sterling College joined the Work Colleges Consortium in 1999 and the Center for Northern Studies, which had been operating in neighboring Wolcott since 1971, merged with Sterling College in 2003.



Campus.

The primary campus is 130 acres (526,091 m²). It has 14 buildings including a woodworking shop and a library. Outdoor teaching facilities include a managed woodlot, a challenge course, a 30-foot climbing tower, organic gardens, and a working livestock farm with two solar/wind powered barns. Much of what is grown and raised is consumed in the dining hall. The Center for Northern Studies at Sterling College is comprised of a 300 acre (1,214,057 m²) boreal wetland and a building containing a library, classroom space, offices and a lounge.

As of 2006, Tefft serves over 800 students. The principal of Tefft is Lavonne Smiley, the vice principal is David Harshbarger. The dean's Assistant is Anthony Coleman. Tefft also has an on-duty police officer named Joe King.



Special Programs.

Tefft Middle School has several special programs. Tefft has special classes for students who are Hard of Hearing (HOH). It also is one of a few middle schools in U-46 that houses a SWAS (School Within A School) program. SWAS is a program for gifted students. The current SWAS teachers are; Reading Mr. Ziegler, English Mrs. Smerecky, Science Mrs. Hernandez, Social Studies Mrs. Kukla, and Math Mr. McLear.



History.

Tefft Middle school is named after the Tefft Family. The Tefft was an important family in Elgin history. The family helped to begin major farming and industry in the Elgin and Hanover Township area 1835 through the late 1840's. Later in 1852 Phineas Smith hauled milk via an ox team to elgin which was then sent to Chicago on the Galena and Chicago Union railroad. The railroad was built in 1850. Tefft began as the school district's first junior high school and later became a middle school. Tefft middle school was founded in 1964.



Houses of Learning.

Tefft divides its students up into groups called houses (commonly referred to as ""cores"" or ""teams""). All the students in the same house share the same teachers (the only exceptions are physical education and rotation teachers). These are the different houses:

 Athena- includes both 7th and 8th graders;

 Atlantis- includes only 7th graders;

 Atlas- includes both 7th and 8th grade hard of hearing students;

 Gladiators- includes both 7th and 8th grade ""SWAS"" students;

 Pegasus- includes only 8th grade students;

 Titans- includes only 7th grade students;

 Zeus- includes only 8th grade students;



Extracurricular Activities.

Like most U46 schools, Tefft offers several extracurricular activities.



Band, Orchestra, and Chorus.

Students at Tefft have the opportunity to play in the school band or orchestra. As of 2006, students also have the option to join an in-school choir. The Tefft band is directed by Daniel Dorotiak, the Tefft orchestra by Donna Garcia, and the Tefft Choir by David Hain. Band, orchestra, and chorus members are not able to participate in rotation classes.



Rotation Classes.

Students who do not take band, orchestra, or chorus along with the five ""core"" classes (Social Studies/History, English, Reading, Math and Science) take ""rotation"" classes. These classes last six weeks and include drama, music, art, family and consumer sciences, industrial education, and computers.



Sports.

Tefft students can participate in sports. In the fall boys can play football and girls can play volleyball. In the early winter and late winter, students can play on the Tefft basketball team. The sports teams play the teams of all the other middle schools in the district. Tefft and nearby Eastview Middle School and Canton middle school have a small rivalry, due to their close proximity to each other. The boys and girls 7th grade basketball team of 2006 won the district championship, going 13-1 for both genders.



Feeder Schools.

Student attending Tefft come from several different feeder schools. Students from either Heritage, Parkwood, Glenbrook, Horizon, or Sunnydale Elementary Schools attend Tefft after completing 6th grade. After completing 8th grade, these students will attend Streamwood High School. Students who attended Horizon Elementary School and Ontarioville Elementary School will attend Bartlett High School. Some will attend South Elgin High School.Students who apply for educational academies in 8th grade will attend the high school where the academy is housed.

3272557,Félix Lajkó,"Félix Lajkó (Serbian:             ) (born December 17, 1974 in Ba ka Topola, Vojvodina, Yugoslavia) is an ethnic Hungarian ""world music"" violinist and composer from Vojvodina. 



Lajkó's music is difficult to categorize; it is based on wide spectrum of influences of traditional string music from Pannonian plain. It can be viewed as a specific form of jazz, but based on traditional music of Hungary and Vojvodina.



He is a virtuoso violinist, playing with great fervor and passion, and occasionally he plays other traditional instruments, such as Cimbalom. On concerts, he usually performs with his small band, but sometimes also plays solo violin.

419644,Alternative education,"Alternative education, also known as non-traditional education or educational alternative, is a broad term which may be used to refer to all forms of education outside of traditional education (for all age groups and levels of education). This may include both forms of education designed for students with special needs (ranging from teenage pregnancy to intellectual disability) and forms of education designed for a general audience which employ alternative educational philosophies and/or methods. 



Alternatives of the latter type are often the result of education reform and are rooted in various philosophies that are commonly fundamentally different from those of traditional compulsory education. While some have strong political, scholarly, or philosophical orientations, others are more informal associations of teachers and students dissatisfied with certain aspects of traditional education. These alternatives, which include charter schools, alternative schools, independent schools, and home-based learning vary widely, but often emphasize the value of small class size, close relationships between students and teachers, and a sense of community.



In certain places, especially in the United States, the term alternative may largely refer to forms of education catering to ""at risk"" students or students with other kinds of special needs, as it is, for example, in this definition drafted by the Massachusetts Department of Education.  Other words used in place of alternative by many educational professionals include non-traditional, non-conventional, or non-standardized, although these terms are used somewhat less frequently and may have negative connotations and multiple meanings. Those involved in forms of education which differ in their educational philosophy (as opposed to their intended pupil base) often use words such as authentic, holistic, and progressive as well. However, these words each have different meanings which are more specific or more ambiguous than simply alternative.



 Overview .



While pedagogical controversy is very old, ""alternative education"" presupposes some kind of orthodoxy which the alternative is in opposition to.  In general, this limits the term to the last two or perhaps three centuries, with the rise of standarized and, later, compulsory education at the primary and secondary levels.  Many critics in this period have suggested that the education of young people should be undertaken in radically different ways than ones in practice.  In the 19th century, the Swiss humanitarian Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, the American transcendentalists Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau, the founders of progressive education John Dewey and Francis Parker, and educational pioneers such as Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner (founder of the Waldorf schools), among others, all insisted that education should be understood as the art of cultivating the moral, emotional, physical, psychological, and spiritual aspects of the developing child.  Anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Fransisco Ferrer y Guardia emphasized education as a force for political liberation, secularism, and elimination of class distinctions. 



More recently, social critics such as John Caldwell Holt, Paul Goodman, Frederick Mayer and Ivan Illich have examined education from more individualist, anarchist, and libertarian perspectives, that is, critiques of the ways that they feel conventional education subverts democracy by molding young people's understandings. Other writers, from the revolutionary Paulo Freire to American educators like Herbert Kohl and Jonathan Kozol, have criticized mainstream Western education from the viewpoint of their varied left-liberal and radical politics.



 Modern forms .



A wide variety of educational alternatives exist at the elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education. These generally fall into four major categories: school choice, alternative school, independent school, and home-based education. These general categories can be further broken down into more specific practices and methodologies. 



 School choice .



The public school options include entirely separate schools in their own settings as well as classes, programs, and even semi-autonomous ""schools within schools."" Public school choice options are open to all students in their communities, though some have waiting lists. Among these are charter schools, combining private initiatives and state funding; and magnet schools, which attract students to particular themes, such as performing arts.



 Alternative school .



In education, the phrase alternative school, sometimes referred to as a minischool, or remedial school, is any public or private school having a special curriculum, especially an elementary or secondary school offering a more flexible program of study than a traditional school.  A wide range of philosophies and teaching methods are offered by alternative schools; some have strong political, scholarly, or philosophical orientations, while others are more ad-hoc assemblies of teachers and students dissatisfied with some aspect of traditional education.  Today, alternative schools cater to students who have special educational needs as well as those who would like to experience school differently.  There are similar programs that exist in higher education settings that serve adults returning to school.



 Independent school .



Independent, or private, schools have more flexibility in staff selection and educational approach. The most plentiful of these are Montessori schools, Waldorf schools (the latter are also called Steiner schools after their founder), and Friends schools. Other independent schools include democratic, or free schools such as Sands School, Summerhill School and Sudbury Valley School, Krishnamurti schools, open classroom schools, those based on experiential education, as well as schools which teach using international curriculum such as the International Baccalaureate and Round Square schools. An increasing number of traditionally independent school forms now also exist within state-run, public education; this is especially true of the Waldorf and Montessori schools. The majority of independent schools offer at least partial scholarships.





 Home-based education .



Families who seek alternatives based on educational, philosophical, or religious reasons, or if there appears to be no nearby educational alternative can decide to have home-based education. Some call themselves unschoolers, for they follow an approach based on interest, rather than a set curriculum. Others enroll in umbrella schools which provide a curriculum to follow. Many choose this alternative for religious-based reasons, but practitioners of home-based education are of all backgrounds and philosophies.



 Correctional Education .





 Other .



There are also some interesting grey areas. For instance, home-educators have combined to create resource centers where they meet as often as five or more days a week, but their members all consider themselves home-educated. In some states publicly run school districts have set up programs for homeschoolers whereby they are considered enrolled, and have access to school resources and facilities. 



Also, many traditional schools have incorporated methods originally found only in alternative education into their general approach, so the line between alternative and mainstream education is continually becoming more blurred.



 Internationally .



 Canada .



In Canada, some privately run schools receive government school funding. 



The Toronto District School Board has adopted alternative programs into their school system. Sometimes these take the form of entire schools, like Mountview Alternative School which shares space with the much larger Keele Elementary School in Toronto's High Park-Junction, and sometime they are programs within schools, like the Triangle Program, Canada's only high school program designed especially for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students.



Then there are also schools like Divine Class, a holistic non-school that guides and certifies average people (aged 18+) how to read people, situations, and events through alternative methods such as Tarot, psychic ability, and esoteric systems.



In Quebec the Universal School of Life has been around for more than 23 years and is focused on Indigo Children and Families and has created a way of life for Indigo Families. see: http://universalschooloflife.com



 England .



Sands School is an alternative school in the UK.  It has only 65 students, with a high ratio of teachers.  The students learn at their own pace in a supportive environment.  The school is run democratically, with the students having as much say in how the school is run as the staff.  Decisions are made by voting in a weekly school meeting, where matters ranging from what colour the new carpets should be, to the employment of new staff.  The school offers a full range of subjects, and attendance to lessons is negotiated, not compulsory.  The school also educates students on a larger range than most schools, and gives students choice in what they can learn.  Their interests form a large part of what is offered in the curriculum.



 Australia .



Preshil, in Kew, Australia, was established in the 1930s. It is one of the few alternative schools in Australia that is unaffiliated with any doctrinal or theological movement. Its primary school has run since established by Margaret Lyttle in 1931, and the secondary school since the late 1970's.

 United States .

Terra Bella Academy, in Mountain View, CA is a publicly funded alternative public school for 8th through 12th grades with about a 1/12 student teacher ratio. The academic curriculum is affiliated with the University of Santa Clara (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and includes social interactive and team building activities.

 India .

In India, beginning in the early part of the 20th century, many educational theorists have discussed and implimented radically different forms of education. Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan and Mahatma Gandhi's ideal of ""basic education"" are primary examples. In recent years many new alternative schools have formed, like Sarang Palakad Kerala, Adharshila Saakad MP, Sita School - Bangalore, Kanavu, and Timbaktoo Collective Andhra Pradesh. At higher levels of education one finds educational alternatives like multiversity.com  that hold open knowledge as an ideal. In the last few decades holistic education, in which the environment of the student is considered an essential part of the educational process, has become popular.

3519472,Theodore O'Hara,"Theodore O'Hara (February 11, 1820 - June 6, 1867) was a poet and Confederate colonel, best known for the poems ""The Bivouac of the Dead"" and ""The Old Pioneer"".



The Early Years: Professor, Lawyer, Colonel.



O'Hara was born to Mr. and Mrs. Kane O'Hara in Danville, Kentucky before the family moved to Frankfort. He continued his education at St. Joseph Academy in Bardstown, Kentucky, where he also served as a Greek professor during his senior year. He later studied law with student John C. Breckinridge before being appointed for a position in the United States Treasury department in 1845. As the Mexican-American War was just beginning, O'Hara signed up for the U.S. Army and held the positions of captain and quartermaster of volunteers as of June 26, 1846. For excellent conduct in the Battle of Contreras and Churubusco, O'Hara was honored with the rank of brevet-major on August 20, 1847. O'Hara wrote his first poem, ""The Bivouac of the Dead"" in honor of the Second Kentucky Regiment officers who died in the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847. Long before the officers were buried at the state cemetery in Frankfort on June 20, 1847, there was a dedication ceremony for a monument in honor of these men. Lines from the poem would eventually grace the gates of numerous national cemeteries. After the war ended in 1848, O'Hara returned to Washington, D.C. to continue his law practices until 1851.



The Later Years: Editor, Diplomat, Confederate.



O'Hara joined others from Kentucky in an expedition to Cuba in 1850. He commanded a regiment in the battle of Cárdenas before a severe injury. He was appointed captain of the Second Calvary on March 3, 1855 before resigning on December 1, 1856. When John Forsyth Jr., editor-in-chief of the Mobile Register became minister to Mexico in 1856, O'Hara took his place in the newspaper. He also edited for the Louisville Times and the Yeoman. He continued to follow government orders, such as his diplomatic mission into the Tehuantepec grant debate. At the beginning of the War Between the States, O'Hara joined the Confederate army and became colonel of the Twelfth Alabama Regiment. He later served with General Albert Sidney Johnston and General John C. Breckinridge, his fellow law student. After the war ended, O'Hara went to Columbus, Georgia to be in the cotton business, but eventually lost his business to a fire. He later resided on a plantation near Guerrytown, Alabama where he died and was returned to Columbus for burial. On September 15, 1874, his remains, along with those of other Mexican War officers were buried in the state cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. O'Hara's friend Sergeant Henry T. Stanton read ""The Bivouac of the Dead"" at the reinterment and said, ""O Hara, in giving utterance to this song, became at once the builder of his own monument and the author of his own epitaph.""

73427,Detour (1945 film),"Detour is a 1945 film noir cult classic that stars Tom Neal, Ann Savage, Claudia Drake and Edmund MacDonald. A B-movie, it was shot in six days.  The film, budgeted for $89,000, ended up costing $117,000 to make.  To preserve the film's right-to-left orientation used in the cross-country scenes, the director reversed many of the hitchhiking shots so that the cars appear to be on the wrong side of the road.



The movie was adapted by Martin Goldsmith and Martin Mooney (uncredited) from Martin Goldsmith's novel, and was directed by Edgar G. Ulmer.  The 68-minute film was created and released by the Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC).  Because the 1945 Production code mandated that ""murderers... must be brought to justice"" in all films made, director Ulmer satisfied censors by ending the movie with Al the hitchhiker being picked up after predicting his arrest earlier.



 Plot .



A piano player, Al (Neal), sets off hitchhiking his way to California to be with his girl. Along the way, a stranger in a convertible gives him a ride. While driving, Al stops to put the top up during a rainstorm.  He discovers that the owner of the car has died in his sleep.  Al panics and dumps the body in a gully and drives off in his car. Later, he picks up another hitchhiker.  Vera, (Savage) a femme fatale, threatens to turn him in for the supposed murder unless he assumes the identity of the dead man to collect an inheritance.





The film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.  Critical response to the film today is almost universally positive. TIME lists the film in the magazine's All Time 100 Films, and film critic Roger Ebert wrote of the film:

""This movie from Hollywood's poverty row, shot in six days, filled with technical errors and ham-handed narrative, starring a man who can only pout and a woman who can only sneer, should have faded from sight soon after it was released in 1945. And yet it lives on, haunting and creepy, an embodiment of the guilty soul of film noir. No one who has seen it has easily forgotten it.""

I know.  Someday a car will stop to pick me up that I never thumbed.  Yes, fate, or some mysterious force can put the finger on you or me for no good reason at all.

2375428,"Mabasa, Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya","Mabasa is a barangay of Dupax del Norte in the province of Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. It was one of the oldest barrio of Dupax (when the town was not yet divided into two, Dupax del Norte and Dupax del Sur). Mabasa was originally called San Roque, named by the parish priest of Dupax after the saint of hunters because the place then was a thick forest where game was abundant such as deers and wild pigs.



History.

The first settlers of San Roque were Ilokano migrants from the town of Paoay in Ilocos Norte and from Alcala and San Nicolas towns in Pangasinan. They travelled by foot and by horses and carabaos through San Nicolas, Pangasinan, passing through Imugan, Santa Fe, Nueva Vizcaya because that was the shortest way possible during those times. The migrants settled at Sitio Poonan (later called Puongan). The family of Apolonio Vadil was the first settler in Poungan. Old records from the Roman Catholic Church in Dupax del Sur showed that the daughter of Apolonio Vadil, Tomasa, was baptized on October 10, 1887.



More migrants came and settled along the Apean (Apayan) River from Puongan upstream and occupied the western part of the barrio now called Riverside East and Riverside West. The settlers found the place always flowing with abundant water coming from a spring in the eastern part of the barrio, and so they called the place ""Nabasa"" which means ""wet"" in Iloko language. It was later officially called ""Mabasa"" changing the old name ""San Roque."""

9377383,Catamount Ski Area,"Catamount Ski Area is a  ski resort located in the Berkshire Mountains in Hillsdale, New York and South Egremont, Massachusetts. It is one of the few remaining family-owned ski areas. While in comparison to ""big"" mountains in the Northeast, it is small, but it provides some of the best skiing close to New York City (a mere two hours away). While many families tend to prefer nearby Butternut, Catamount has a more diverse and challenging range of trails, including Catapult, one of the steepest trails in the Northeast. In addition, because Butternut now has multiple High-Speed Quad Chairlifts, it is often too crowded. Catamount lifts have short lines and the trails have less people, which means more skiing. 



History.



Catamount first open for business in 1939 with three rope tows. But the mountain remained relatively unpopular for a good amount of time. In the 1950s, Jiminy Peak and Butternut Ski areas opened, the other two mountains in the Berkshires and skiing in the area began to become more popular.   



Bill Gilbert and Don Edwards took over management and bought Catamount in 1974 and made it what it is today. Both men had a lot of experience manging mountains. Since they have taken over, a lot of new terrain has been added, including Catapult, Sidewinder, and Promenade, and new chairlifts. When they bought the mountain, less than 25% of the mountain was covered by snowmaking and now more than 98% is covered.

Plans for the Future.



Catamount has begun its renovation project to compete with neighboring Butternut. In Summer 2006, the Summit Quad Chairlift was completed. In coming years, an 126 Condo Complex will be built around a lake at the base with ski in/out access. The new condos will also include a retail shopping, dining, a spa, and parking. It will operate year round. The renovations are seomwhat similar to Jiminy Peak's recent upgrades.



Skiing the Mountain.



A few years ago, many would choose Butternut over Catamount because of its draw for families. Butternut has a lot of easier trails. But Catamount has recently dedicated an entire area to beginners called the Meadows and it is serviced by its own triple chair lift. The triple offers to places to get off. One is halfway up the mountain where you can take Ali's Alley or Kelli's Run to various other greens. 



The mountain offers an incredible variety of terrain for a small mountain. It has difficult trails such as Catapult, one of the steepest trails in the Northeast. It has black diamond cruisers such as Alley Cat and a favorite intermediate cruiser in Sidewinder. If one should desire a nice, long trail, one could take Ridge Run to Promenade for a 2.5 mile easy run.



The views while skiing are incredible. Some of the notable views include when you ski on the New York side from the Summit right before you get on Glade. When you reach the bottom of Lower Glade or Upper Alleycat, there is a fabulous view of the rest of the mountain. Likewise, when coming down Mountain View on the Massachusetts side, you can see the rest of the mountain.



Overall, the mountain is great for what it is. It is small but will keep you busy all day. It is uncrowded and family friendly.



Tips for a Great Day

Stay away from the Catamount Double Chairlift. It is always crowded and does not take you high enough to make it worth the wait. Just go to the top.

Ski during lunch time. Everyone goes inside the lodges then and the lines are very short.

If you can't ski all day. Get there early so you can get the good snow and short lines. If not, you gotta wait til the end of the day for short lines and by then, the snow is no good.









Trail Reviews.



Easiest (Green Circle)

Ali's Alley - Has no snowmaking and therefore is rarely open. Nice easy Green.

Kelli's Run - Perfect green run for beginners. Not steep but steep enough to get going if you want.

Cat's Meow - Flat trail that takes you from the middle of the mounatin over to the meadows. At times you must ""skate"" so you can move because the trail is so flat.

Colonel's Caper - A surprisingly fun green that can take you from one side of the triple chair to the other. ;

Esplanade - A great, wide green trail. Excellent for all abilities and easy to learn techniques, etc. Makes Walter's Way worth taking.

Holiday - Great, wide, expansive green trail. Steep at the end.

Upper and Lower Promenade - Great, flat trail, with some surprisingly decent pitches at times. Fun trail for beginners, giving them a long option from to top of the meadows. Beautiful views at the beginning.



More Difficult (Blue Square)

Catamount - great wide trail with decent pitch. An excellent way to finish Chute and Glade although not entiely worth it if you only take the Catamount Doublt to the middle.

Chute - Great way to zip down from Alley Cat to the middle of the mountain. Steep pitch. You can really get some speed and finish off with an array of blue and black trails at the bottom, including Catamount.

Ridge Run - beginning of the longest run on the mountain. It starts off slow and flat but you soon encounter a number of good pitches. The run always has a good amount of snow on it. Gives you options when you get to the meadows.

Mountain View - one of two blue options when you finish Ridge Run. Has fabulous views of the mountain and is a wide trail with decent pitch. Great snow grooming and one of the most underrated trails on the mountain. You meet Holiday at the bottom.

Walter's Way - The other of the two blue options in the meadows. It's okay and has a decent pitch but is often very icy. What makes the trail worth it is after when you get to Esplanade, which is arguably better than Holiday.

Race Slope - small trail from middle of the mountain. It's okay. usually closed for Race Training.

Upper and Lower Sidewinder - Since it's addition it has been one of the most popular trails on the mountain. It is a great long cruiser with steep pitches and not as steep pitches, making it truly enjoyable. It is filled with twists and turns including great views as you pass through the trees and weave through the mountain. One downside is , because of it's popularity, by the end of the day it is icy, especially Upper Sidewinder.



Most Difficult (Black Diamond)

Upper and Lower Glade - A great, wide black trail with nice pitch, especially right before you get to the middle of the mountain. Can be icy at times.

Upper and Lower Alley Cat - Simply the best trail on the mountain for good skiers. It has fabulous twists and turns, great snowmaking, and rarely has people on it. Great, steep pitches allowing for great speed.

 

Expert (Double Black Diamond)

Catapult - One of the steepest trails in the Northeast. Enough said. very difficult, especially with moguls.



Costs.



Season Passes



A season pass purchase at Catamount is one of the best values in skiing. If you buy in the spring or summer before the season, you can get a great deal of $200 for adults, $150 for juniors and seniors, $100 for kids. Also, if you buy in March, you can ski free that march. If you buy at the right time, it pays in four visits. Not to mention the discount at the Cat's Paw Retail Shop and discounts at other mountains.

 Statement  .

Let A(x) be a non-negative, monotonic decreasing function of x, defined for . Suppose that



;



converges for Re(s)>1 to the function f(s) and that f(s) is analytic for , except for a simple pole at s=1 with residue 1: that is,  is continuous in . Then the limit as x goes to infinity of e(-x)A(x) is equal to 1.



 Application .



An important number-theoretic application of the theorem is to Dirichlet series of the form 



 ;



where a(n) is non-negative.  If the series converges to an analytic function in 



 ;



with a simple pole of residue c at s=b, then 



.



Applying this to the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function, where the coefficients in the Dirichlet series are values of the von Mangoldt function, it is possible to deduce the prime number theorem from the fact that the zeta function has no zeroes on the line

6140010,Bukit Timah Road,"Bukit Timah Road (Chinese:      ; Malay: Jalan Bukit Timah) is a major road in Singapore extending from the city centre to Woodlands Road on the way to Johor Bahru in Malaysia. The road has a distance of 25km, which is one of the longest roads in Singapore, and the road takes its name from the hill. En route, it passes through the areas of Little India, Newton Road, Farrer Road, Singapore Botanic Gardens and Bukit Timah. 



Bukit Timah Road splits into two roads at Newton Circus, the west-bound Bukit Timah Road and east-bound Dunearn Road, both of which straddle a canal along their entire lengths. Bukit Timah Road begins at the junction with Rochor Canal Road, Serangoon Road and Selegie Road just south of Tekka Centre as Bukit Timah Road, follows a canal in a northwest direction up to its junction with Clementi Road where it continues northwards as Upper Bukit Timah Road (       ) until the junction with Bukit Panjang Road and Choa Chu Kang Road near the Ten Mile Junction shopping mall as Woodlands Road. The road passes through the Bukit Timah Planning Area. Buildings named after the road are Bukit Timah Plaza and Bukit Timah Shopping Centre. 



History.

The road was built in 1845 and the area was infested with tigers that it was a serious threat to humans. The first horseback ride in the island was along Bukit Timah in 1840, which took four days and was made by Mr Thomson and Dr. Little. In 1860, about 200 were killed by the tigers in and about the gambier and pepper plantations. The road was also the last defensive stand against the Japanese army in 1942. The British surrendered to the Japanese at the Old Ford Motor Factory at Upper Bukit Timah Road. A canal was built in later years between Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road to solve the flooding problem in the area. In the 1990s, a tunnel and a flyover was constructed namely the Bukit Timah Underpass and the Wayang Satu Flyover. The Newton Flyover exists since the 1970s which goes over the junction of Newton Circus.



Etymology.



Bukit Timah Road is known as tek kha kang a ki in Hokkien, which means ""the side of the stream in tek kha (Selegie Road) district"". This only refers to the eastern end of the road. The Wayang Satu (Whitley) and Bukit Timah village were differently called. They also referred the road as bee chia lo bue, meaning the ""end of the horse carriage road"". 



Landmarks.

Along the road, major landmarks include Tekka Centre, Little India MRT Station, Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital, Kampong Java Park, Newton Food Centre, Newton MRT Station, Balmoral Plaza, Singapore Botanic Gardens, Serene Centre, Coronation Plaza, Hwa Chong Institution, Methodist Girls' School and King Albert Park. At Upper Bukit Timah Road, landmarks include Bukit Timah Plaza, Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre, Beauty World, Cheong Chin Nam Road, Hoover Park, Rail Mall and the Old Ford Motor Factory.

1081474,COMPUTE!,"COMPUTE! () was a computer magazine that was published from 1979 to 1994. In its 1980s heyday it covered all major platforms, and several single-platform spinoffs of the magazine were launched. One of these was COMPUTE!'s Gazette, catering to Commodore computer users.



Its original goal was to write about and publish programs for all of the computers that used some version of the MOS Technology 6502 CPU. It started out with the Commodore PET, Commodore Vic-20, the Atari 8-bit series, the Apple II plus, and some 6502-based computers one could build from kits, such as the Rockwell AIM 65, the KIM-1 by MOS Technology, and others from companies such as Ohio Scientific. Support for the kit computers and the Commodore PET were eventually dropped. The platforms that became mainstays at the magazine were the Commodore Vic-20, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit series, TI-99/4A, and the Apple II series. Later on the IBM PC, Atari ST series, and the Commodore Amiga series computers were added to its line-up.



In addition, COMPUTE! published a large number of computer books.



Most personal computers of the time came with some version of the BASIC programming language. The magazine often featured type-in programs written in these versions of BASIC for their respective computers. Machine code programs were also published, usually for simple video games listed as hexadecimal numbers that could be POKEd into the memory of a home computer such as a VIC-20 or Atari 400. Machine language listings could also be entered in decimal with a program provided in each issue called MLX (available for Apple II and Commodore hardware, and written in Basic). It was noted particularly for software such as the multiplatform word processor SpeedScript, and the spreadsheet SpeedCalc.



Editors of the magazine included Founder Robert Lock, Richard Mansfield, Charles Brannon, and Tom R. Halfhill. Noted columnists included Jim Butterfield, educator Fred D'ignazio and science fiction author Orson Scott Card.



In May 1988, the magazine changed its focus to PCs and PC clones and dispensed with the type-in listings. During the early 1990s, with the decline of the home computer market in favor of the PC market, COMPUTE! went out of publication for a while until it was sold to General Media, publishers at the time of Omni and Penthouse magazines. Ziff Davis bought COMPUTE!'s assets, including its subscriber list, in 1994. General Media had ceased its publication before the sale.(3)



Where are they now?.

Robert Lock: After founding COMPUTE! Publications, Lock started another successful company, Signal Research, which was among the first to publish magazines and books about computer games. He also wrote the book, The Traditional Potters of Seagrove, N.C. in 1994, and started Southern Arts Journal a quarterly magazine featuring essays, fiction and poetry about all things Southern, in 2005.(1)



Richard Mansfield: Mansfield has written many books, mostly on Microsoft technologies, including Visual Basic .NET All in One Desk Reference for Dummies, Visual Basic .NET Power Tools, Office 2003 Application Development All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition For Dummies, and CSS Web Design For Dummies. He also writes occasional pieces for DevX.com. He created much controversy with an article he wrote there called OOP is Much Better in Theory Than in Practice.



Tom R. Halfhill: Halfhill went on to become a senior editor at Byte. He currently writes for Microprocessor Report and Maximum PC.(2)

Founding.

Cascade was founded by Desh Deshpande in 1990, and was led by CEO Dan Smith.  



Product.

Cascade made a compact Frame Relay system.  This system allowed Service providers to deliver ATM-based Frame Relay service in an efficient and cost-effective package.  



Their most important direct competitor was StrataCom, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996 for US $4B.



Acquisition.

In 1997, Ascend Communications acquired Cascade Communications for US $3.7 Billion, to move into ATM and Frame Relay markets. Ascend was later acquired by Lucent Technologies in 1999 in one of the largest mergers in communications equipment history (US $24 Billion).  The Cascade portion of Ascend's business was more interesting to Lucent than the modem termination business that comprised the rest of Ascend.



The seed of startups.

Both Desh Deshpande and CEO Dan Smith profited handsomely from the acqusition, as did hundreds of Cascade employees.  In addition, Cascade was notable for invigorating the telecommunications startup culture in Massachusetts in the mid 1990s.  Cascade alumni were founders or key contributors to many other financially successful telecom companies:



 ArrowPoint, founded by Cheng Wu.  ArrowPoint was bought by Cisco for $5.7B during the height of the telecom bubble. ;

571313,François Coty,"François Coty (born Joseph Marie François Spoturno; May 3 1874, Ajaccio, Corsica July 25 1934, Louveciennes) was a French perfume manufacturer and the founder of the fascist paramilitary group Solidarité Française.



He married Yvonne Alexandrine Le Baron in 1900, and took the more French-looking name Coty, a variation on his mother's maiden name, when he moved to Paris.



He began by selling essences derived from flowers in Grasse, and then peddled his scents to the barbers of Paris. His genius, however, was in marketing and in recognizing that the bottle made the perfume. He had bottles designed by the great ceramist René Lalique. His Rose Jacqueminot scent, in a bottle by Baccarat, was his first great success. Coty's great success, Chypre, gave its name to an entire fragrance family used in the industry's classifications.



He was one of the wealthiest men in France and owned two Paris newspapers, the working class L'Ami du peuple and the aristocratic Le Figaro. He also bought the hunting pavilion of Louveciennes near Saint-Germain-en-Laye, once the property of Madame du Barry. He built multiple large residences, but lived in a hotel on the Champs-Élysées.



Coty was something of a recluse, disliking crowds of any kind, and hiding behind his public image. The company he founded in 1904 is now Coty, Inc., based in New York City.



The movement he founded drew on the previous Coty-backed groups Faisceau and Croix-de-Feu. Solidarité Française attempted to become the equivalent of the Italian National Fascist Party, with Coty as France's Benito Mussolini (he styled himself the French Duce). Never anything but marginal, the group peaked during the February 6, 1934 rally in front of the Palais Bourbon, when it attempted, in alliance with other far right groups, to topple the Third Republic (Coty had the ambition of having it replaced with a monarchy). The group was outlawed in 1936, through a decision taken by the Popular Front government.



The Stade François Coty in Ajaccio was named after him.

77776,All-Fours,"All-Fours is a card game known in America as Old Sledge, or Seven Up. It is usually played by four players, with the full pack of fifty-two cards, which rank in play as at Whist, the ace being the highest, and the two

the lowest. The game is seven points.



The game is very popular in Blackburn, England, where it is traditionally played in pubs .  Even at the present time it is still organised into pub teams who play on Sunday nights.  Nobody is quite sure how long this game has been played in Blackburn, but it has been a fixture in pubs there for a long time.



The game has also been exported to the island nation of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, where is it is the de-facto ""National"" card game.



There are four different items which count towards the score, whence the name All-Fours. Such items are as follows:



High.--The highest trump out, scoring one to the

original holder.



Low.--The lowest trump out, scoring one to the

original holder.



Jack.--The knave of trumps, scoring one to the

dealer, if turned up; if otherwise, to the winner of

the trick to which it falls.



Game.--Scoring one to the ultimate holder of

the more valuable cards in the tricks won by him,

according to the following scale:



For each ten (trump or otherwise)     10;

For each ace                           4;

For each king                          3;

For each queen                         2;

For each knave                         1;



In the case of the players being equal in this particular, or of neither party holding any card which counts towards Game, the elder hand scores the point.



Method of Playing.



The players cut for deal, the highest card having the preference. (This is the old-fashioned rule, but at the present day the Whist rule of ""lowest card deals"" is frequently followed.) The dealer gives six cards to each, turning up the thirteenth as trump. If the elder hand is dissatisfied with his cards, he may say, ""I beg,"" in which case the dealer is bound either to allow him (by the phrase, ""Take one"") to score one point, or to give each player three more cards from the pack, turning up that next following by way of fresh trump card. If this should be of the same suit as the original trump, the dealer is bound to give three more cards to each, again turning up the seventh, until a new suit does actually turn up. If the turn-up card is a knave, the dealer scores one, this taking precedence over any other score. If, by reason of the elder hand ""begging,"" there is a further deal, and the dealer a second time turns up a knave, he again scores one. The elder hand leads any card he pleases. His antagonist must follow suit or trump, his right to do the latter not being affected by his holding cards of the suit led. If, however, having a card of the suit led, he neither follows suit nor trumps, he becomes liable to the penalty of a revoke.



The player of the highest card of the suit led, or a trump, wins the trick, which is turned down as at Whist, and the hand progresses through the six tricks. In scoring, the order of precedence is (1) High, (2) Low, (3) Jack, (4) Game; subject, as we have seen, to the contingency of ""Jack"" having been the turn-up card, the point for this being scored before the hand is played.



The play is mainly directed toward capturing the Jack, and such cards as may score towards Game.



Some players score a point whenever the adversary does not follow suit or trump. Some, again, make it the rule that each player must count his score without looking at his tricks, under penalty of losing one or more points, as may be agreed, in the event of a miscalculation.



Historically, the lowest court playing card was termed the ""knave"", not the ""Jack"".

However, due to the influence of the All-fours game, the knaves were increasingly referred to as

""Jacks"". When indices were added to playing cards, the lowest court card was abbreviated as

""J"" (Jack) in Anglo-American cards because ""Kn"" (Knave) was too similar to ""K"" (King),

and from then on the lowest court card in such decks has been referred to as the ""Jack"".

Historically, All-Fours was a card game played by the lower classes, and thus even the term ""Jack"" was at one time considered vulgar.



Other meanings.

The expression on ""all fours"" sometimes refers to a crouched position of being on hands and knees, or bending down to touch the floor or ground with both hands while still standing (also see Adho Mukha Svanasana).

In the strictest sense, oenophilia describes a disciplined devotion to wine, accompanying strict traditions of consumption and appreciation. In a general sense however, oenophilia simply refers to the enjoyment of wine, often by laypersons.



Oenophiles are also known as a wine aficionados or connoisseurs. They are people who appreciate or collect wine, particularly grape wines from certain regions, varietal types, or methods of manufacture. While most oenophiles are normal, everyday people, some may also be vintners, wine merchants, or as in the case of Robert Parker, one who tastes and grades wines for a living. 



The oenophile stereotype is often used for comedic effect, a well-known example being the 2004 comedy Sideways.

4946462,Tom Papania,"Tom Papania (b. May 30, 1944) is a Christian evangelist who claims before his conversion that he was a high-ranking enforcer in the Gambino crime family. However, his account is questioned by leading writers and schlders including noted Mafia expert and founder of Ganglandnews.com, Jerry Capeci, writer Rocky Scarfone (who claims that many of the stories Papania tells as his own were stolen from his own autobiography, House of Cards: The Curse of Alphonso) and researchers Wayne Robinson  and Brian Karjala  who have researched and posted information, email, official U.S. Government documents, and certified arrest and imprisonment records concerning Papania at The Rogues Gallery.   



Papania's claimed history.

According to Papania's claims, he grew up in an Italian (Sicilian) family in New York City. Born Thomas Anthony Papanier to the son of a laborer, Tom did not realize until his teens that his late grandfather on his mother's side was Joe ""The Boss"" Mazaria whom the FBI claims originally brought the mob overseas from Europe.  Due to a lack of a purposeful relationship with his father, Tom went on to a life of crime in his mid-teens. For instance, after donning a ski-mask and robbing the corner cafe, a hangout for Italian gangsters, Tom instinctively insisted that they remove their pants   a further disrespect   so they couldn't chase him. Sometime later   Tom states in his messages   three men in black showed up at his home to inform him and his parents that they believed it was Tom who had robbed them and that the only reason he was still alive was due to the respect they had for his grandfather. They warned him that if it happened again, not even the respect for his grandfather could save him. Tom explains that he never even knew of his grandfather and that after this meeting, his dad severely chastened him, warning him not to speak with these men again.  Tom says he was thick headed and having believed that his dad never showed him compassion   he had never taken Tom to ball games nor had ever referred to him as a ""son""   at the next opportunity, he went to those men and demanded to know who his grandfather was. This is how Tom's story begins of his induction into the mafia to become the 3rd highest member under Carlo Gambino. Tom says he was an efficient collector; he threatened people with ice picks or harm toward their family in order to collect on their debts.



The mafia is like a war, inside and out.  Externally they are on constant surveillance by police, and internally there are always members who seek to dethrone those in authority at any expense.  Tom states that attempts were made on his life at least three times; for example, once they kidnapped him, tied him up in a warehouse and set fire to it, but somehow he always managed to escape.



According to Papania, he was ordered to shoot some out-of-state men who robbed the garment district.  He was told that the inside men were takin care of and eliminated, but they wanted to make an example for the guys on the outside by having them shot in the legs. Tom says that he did as ordered, but that when he got in the airplane to head back to New York, the only people in the airplane were police who put him under arrest for the shooting of those men whom, Tom says, he had not even heard of their names until after his arrest. Tom vowed to keep silent and said nothing before the sentencing judge who gave him the maximum penalty, 5 to 7 years.  



After being released on good behavior five years later, Tom was asked to see his Capo (boss of the family).  In a meeting with him, he was asked what he thought about for the past five years: Tom had wondered what he had done wrong to get caught. The men explained to him that it was they who had turned him in as a test of his character, and that he had passed the ultimate test: ""welcome to the family, Son.""  



Tom's anger must have boiled but it all simmered down at the sense of belonging to a family for the first time. He says the Gambinos offered him anything out of the ""black book"" to have control over.  Since Tom liked a few of the discothèques, he asked for a couple of days to think it over.  As the story goes, Tom was given all three of these for his faithful service.



Regardless of all the millions of dollars he was making, Tom says there remained a vacuum in his life.  Papania claims that after his conversion to Christianity, he told Paul Castellano, the current boss at the time, that he was leaving the mafia.  Castellano, according to Papania, had a contract on Tom's life until John Gotti took over in December of 1985.



Ministry.

Tom currently has a ministry for prisoners and their families and shares his story around the world.

In Hackmeetings, local hacklabs and other similar groups  take part in a multitude of activities related to Internet and new technologies, from a political point of view and social, like conferences, round tables, demonstrations, factories and other activities- all of them generally open to the public.



The main reason for this is to present movements like free software, new technologies like wireless and the problems derived from the new technologies like lack of privacy, besides also to spread techniques and applied computer science knowledge of high level.



Meeting places are usually social centers okupados, and public. Hackmeeting is inspired by the event HackIt that began 1998 in Italy, although through the years it has been evolving until obtaining its own identity. It also exists as hackmeeting international, by the alias transhackmeeting, which celebrated its first edition in Croatia."
306725,Wallerfangen,"Wallerfangen is a municipality of Saarlouis district, Saarland, Germany.  Located west of Saarlouis and along the French border, it is the seat of the villages of Ittersdorf, Ihn, Leidingen, St. Barbara, Kerlingen, Gisingen, Rammelfangen, Oberlimberg, Bedersdorf, and Düren. It was established by the Duchy of Lorraine, and belonged to the Duchy until the Napoleonic Wars in the late 18th century, at which time it came under French control. Up until 1687, Wallerfangen possessed town privileges. In that year, the fortifications and most of the buildings were destroyed and the inhabitants were moved to the newly found town-fortress of Saarlouis.



In 1815, under the Treaty of Paris, Prussia assumed control of the area. For all intents and purposes, it remained in the possession of the German Federation of States until 1919. The Treaty of Versailles created an independent and autonomous territory of Saargebiet, administered by France and the League of Nations until 1935. Under the terms of Versailles, the citizens of the Saargebiet voted to become part of Germany, doing so inspite of Adolf Hitler having assumed power in 1933.



World War II brought much despair and bloodshed for Wallerfangen and its citizens. Being the western border of the German Reich, the area became battleground in 1944/45, and the area was evacuated en masse twice. After WWII, Wallerfangen belonged to the newly independent, but French controlled, Saarland."

6540707,Peter Simpson (Native rights activist),"Peter Simpson (1871?-1947) was a Canadian-born Tsimshian activist for Alaska Native rights.  He grew up in Metlakatla, Alaska, but his Tsimshian ancestors were from Lax Kw'alaams and Metlakatla, British Columbia.



Peter Simpson was born July 4, 1871, in Metlakatla or Lax Kw'alaams (a.k.a. Port Simpson), B.C., though there is conflicting information on his date and place of birth.  He was listed as twenty-three years old in 1887 when approximately 800 Tsimshians from ""Old Metlakatla,"" B.C., founded the community of ""New Metlakatla,"" Alaska.  He was a member of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) of the Tsimshian and was raised by an uncle and aunt, Henry and Alice Ridley.  He was also related to the Rev. Edward Marsden.



He was well liked by the Anglican lay minister William Duncan, founder of the Christian utopian communities at both Old and New Metlakatla.  When Simpson was a young man, he was one of the eight people sent in a canoe by Duncan from New Metlakatla to dismantle the church they had left behind at Old Metlakatla.  They hacked it to pieces and burned it to the ground and escaped back to Alaska before they could face prosecution.  (Not all histories of Old Metlakatla record this as the cause of the fire that destroyed the church in 1901.)



Simpson also was a principal investor in the short-lived sawmill community of Port Gravina, near Ketchikan, Alaska, from its founding in 1892 until it burned in 1904.  This was an offshoot of the Metlakatla community, one committed to Presbyterianism under Marsden.  After the fire, Simpson moved to Juneau, and then to Sitka, Alaska.



In 1912, Simpson became chairman of the committee that was eventually to form the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB), and the committee's only non-Tlingit member.  He is considered the father of the ANB and also ""the father of Land Claims"" in Alaska, the long process that led to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (without Metlakatla's participation, interestingly), long after his death.



Simpson is widely known for his famous quotation, uttered to the Tlingit land-claims activist William Paul at the 1925 ANB convention: ""Willie, who owns this land?""  William Paul (after a long pause): ""We do.""  Peter Simpson: ""Then fight for it.""  One biography of Paul, Then Fight for It, by Fred Paul (William's son), derives its title from this exchange.



Simpson helped build Sitka's sawmill in 1935 and was closely involved in the life of the Sheldon Jackson School there (now Sheldon Jackson College).  The school's workboat the SJS was built by Simpson in 1936, and in 1942 it became a U.S. Navy patrol boat.



Simpson's wife, Mary Sloan, was a Tlingit from Sitka.  They raised fifteen children.  He died December 27, 1947, in Sitka.

3116814,"Maréchal, nous voilà !","Maréchal, nous voilà ! (Marshal, here we are!) is a French song dedicated to Marshal Petain. Lyrics were composed by André Montagnard, and music was composed by André Montagnard and Charles Curtioux. The song was performed by André Dassary and whole school children in unoccupied France and Algeria during Vichy France.



La Marseillaise remained the official anthem of the state, but a popular though unofficial patriotic song was Maréchal, nous voilà !. Officially, the song was created in 1940, but Montagnard and Curtioux actually reused another song dedicated to the Tour de France called Voilà le Tour qui passe. The first two lines of that song were:  Attention, les voilà ! les coureurs, les géants de la route.



Lyrics.

Une flamme sacrée

Monte du sol natal

Et la France enivrée

Te salue Maréchal!

Tous tes enfants qui t'aiment

Et vénèrent tes ans

A ton appel suprême

Ont répondu « Présent »



REFRAIN:

Maréchal nous voilà!

Devant toi, le sauveur de la France

Nous jurons, nous, tes gars

De servir et de suivre tes pas

Maréchal nous voilà!

Tu nous as redonné l'espérance

La Patrie renaîtra!

Maréchal, Maréchal, nous voilà!



Tu as lutté sans cesse

Pour le salut commun

On parle avec tendresse

Du héros de Verdun

En nous donnant ta vie

Ton génie et ta foi

Tu sauves la Patrie

Une seconde fois:



REFRAIN



Quand ta voix nous répète

Afin de nous unir:

""Français levons la tête,

Regardons l'avenir!""

Nous, brandissant la toile

Du drapeau immortel,

Dans l'or de tes étoiles,

Nous voyons luire un ciel:



REFRAIN



La guerre est inhumaine

Quel triste épouvantail!

N'écoutons plus la haine

Exaltons le travail

Et gardons confiance

Dans un nouveau destin

Car Pétain, c'est la France,

La France, c'est Pétain!

452451,Howard Scott Warshaw,"Howard Scott Warshaw is a former game designer who worked for Atari in the early 1980s, where he designed and programmed the games Yars' Revenge, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the infamous flop, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He has also written two books and directed two video documentaries.





Warshaw's first success, Yars' Revenge, first started as an Atari 2600 adaptation of the arcade game Star Castle. However, as limitations became clear, Warshaw re-adapted the concept into a new game involving mutated houseflies defending their world against an alien attacker. The game was a major success and is still regarded as one of the best games made for the Atari 2600. This led Warshaw to be picked as the designer of the game adaptation of the film Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was also a commercial success and was critically acclaimed at the time.



It was his success on Raiders that led to Warshaw being chosen to design and program the ill-fated Atari 2600 adaptation of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Problems began early as he was only given five weeks to go from concept to finished product. Amazingly, he was able to finish the game on time. However, it was poorly received, seen as being confusing and frustrating. Atari took a major financial loss on the project, which combined with other poor business decisions and conditions, led to the company being divided and sold within two years. During this time, Warshaw developed and finished another game called Saboteur, which was then re-adapted into a game based on the television series The A-Team. However, Atari was dismantled before either version could be released.



Following the collapse of Atari, Warshaw wrote two books. The first, The Complete Book of PAN, is a guide to the card game of the same name. In the second, Conquering College, Warshaw discusses his techniques toward academic success, referred to as RASABIC (Read Ahead, Stay Ahead, Be In Class) which enabled him to graduate early and save one full year's tuition.

Later, he studied video production, and released the documentary From There to Here: Scenes of Passage., a chronicle of the American immigration of two Russian women from the same family, one in 1912 and the other in 1978. Subsequently he went on to produce the multi-part documentary Once Upon Atari, a collection of interviews and stories of employees and designers at Atari during the late 1970s and early 1980s.



In 2004 classic video game enthusiasts were able to produce cartridges of Saboteur for sale at game expos. It debued at PhillyClassic 5 where Warshaw was at hand to bless the distribution and even autograph the cartridges. That year Atari also released the Atari Flashback system that includes fifteen Atari 2600 and five Atari 7800 titles, including Saboteur.



In his games, Warshaw is also known for always leaving his initials as an Easter Egg. Along with this, in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the player can find a ""Yar;"" and in E.T., the player can find both a ""Yar"" and an ""Indy.""; in Yar's Revenge, if the player stays on the ""mean streak"" while the base is exploding, HSWWSH (his initials forwards and backwards) appear on the screen - and end the game.

355024,Capital (architecture),"In several traditions of architecture including Classical architecture, the capital (from the Latin caput, 'head') forms the crowning member of the column. The capital projects on each side as it rises, in order to support the abacus and unite the form of the latter (normally square) with the circular shaft of the column. The bulk of the capital may either be convex, as in the Doric order; concave, as in the inverted bell of the Corinthian order; or scrolling out, as in the Ionic order. These form the three principal types on which all capitals are based. The Composite order (illustration, right) established in the 16th century on a hint from the Arch of Titus, adds Ionic volutes to Corinthian acanthus leaves.



From the prominent position it occupies in all monumental buildings, the capital is often selected for ornamentation, and is often the clearest indicator of the architectural order (see Orders of architecture). The treatment of its detail may be an indication of the building's date. 



Ancient capitals.



The two earliest Egyptian capitals of importance are those which are based on the lotus and papyrus plants respectively, and these, with the palm tree capital, were the chief types employed by the Egyptians, until under the Ptolemies in the 3rd to 1st centuries BCE, various other river plants were also employed, and the conventional lotus capital went through various modifications.



Some kind of volute capital is shown in the Assyrian bas-reliefs, but no Assyrian capital has ever been found; the enriched bases exhibited in the British Museum were initially misinterpreted as capitals.



 

In the Achaemenid Persian capital the brackets are carved with the lion or the griffin projecting right and left to support the architrave; on their backs they carry other brackets at right angles to support the cross timbers. The profuse decoration underneath the bracket capital in the palaces of Xerxes at Susa and elsewhere, serves no structural function, but gives some variety to the extenuated shaft.



The earliest Aegean capital is that shown in the frescoes at Knossos in Crete (1600 BCE); it was of the convex type, probably moulded in stucco. Capitals of the second, concave type, include the richly carved examples of the columns flanking the Tomb of Agamemnon in Mycenae (c. 1100 BCE): they are carved with a chevron device, and with a concave apophyge on which the buds of some flowers are sculpted.



Classical capitals.

The Doric capital is the simplest of the five Classical orders: it consists of the abacus above an ovolo molding, with an astragal collar set below. In the Temple of Apollo, Syracuse (c. 700 BCE), the echinus moulding has become a more definite form: this in the Parthenon reaches its culmination, where the convexity is at the top and bottom with a delicate uniting curve. The sloping side of the echinus becomes flatter in the later examples, and in the Colosseum at Rome forms a quarter round (See the more complete discussion at Doric order). 



In the Ionic capital (illustration, left), spirally coiled volutes are inserted between the abacus and the ovolo. In the Ionic capitals of the archaic Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (560 BCE) the width of the abacus is twice that of its depth, consequently the earliest Ionic capital known was virtually a bracket capital. A century later, in the temple on the Ilissus, the abacus has become square (See the more complete discussion at Ionic order).





It has been suggested that the foliage of the Greek Corinthian capital was based on the Acanthus spinosus, that of the Roman on the Acanthus mollis. Not all architectural foliage is as realistic as Isaac Ware's (illustration, right) however. The leaves are generally carved in two 'ranks' or bands, like one leafy cup set within another. One of the most beautiful Corinthian capitals is that from the Tholos of Epidaurus (400 BCE); it illustrates the transition between the earlier Greek capital, as at Bassae, and the Roman version that Renaissance and modern architects inherited and refined (See the more complete discussion at Corinthian order).



In Roman architectural practice, capitals are briefly treated in their proper context among the detailing proper to each of the 'Orders', in the only complete architectural textbook to have survived from classical times, the Ten Books on Architecture, by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, better known just as Vitruvius, dedicated to the emperor Augustus. The various orders are discussed in Vitruvius' books iii and iv. Vitruvius describes Roman practice in a practical fashion. He gives some tales about the invention of each of the Orders, but he does not give a hard and fast set of canonical rules for the execution of capitals. 



Two further, specifically Roman orders of architecture have their characteristic capitals, the sturdy and primitive Tuscan capitals, typically used in military buildings, similar to Greek Doric, but with fewer small moldings in its profile, and the invented Composite capitals not even mentioned by Vitruvius, which combined Ionic volutes and Corinthian acanthus capitals, in an order that was otherwise quite similar in proportions to the Corinthian, itself an order that Romans employed much more often than Greeks. 



The increasing adoption of Composite capitals signalled a trend towards freer, more inventive (and often coarser) capitals in Late Antiquity.



Indo-Corinthian capitals.



Main article: Indo-Corinthian capital;

Indo-Corinthian capitals are capitals crowning columns or pilasters, which can be found in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, and usually combine Hellenistic and Indian elements. These capitals are typically dated to the first centuries of our era, and constitute important elements of Greco-Buddhist art.



The Classical design was often adapted, usually taking a more elongated form, and sometimes being combined with scrolls, generally within the context of Buddhist stupas and temples. Indo-Corinthian capitals also incorporated figures of the Buddha or Bodhisattvas, usually as central figures surrounded by, and often under the shade of, the luxurious foliage of Corinthian designs.



Byzantine and Gothic capitals.













Byzantine capitals are of endless variety; the Roman composite capital would seem to have been the favourite type they followed at first: subsequently, the block of stone was left rough as it came from the quarry, and the sculptor, set to carve it, evolved new types of design to his own fancy, so that one rarely meets with many repetitions of the same design. One of the most remarkable is the capital in which the leaves are carved as if blown by the wind; the finest example being in Santa Sophia, Thessalonica; those in the Cathedral of Saint Mark, Venice specially attracted Ruskin's fancy. Others appear in St Apollinare-in-Classe, Ravenna. 



The capital in San Vitale, Ravenna shows above it the dosseret required to carry the arch, the springing of which was much wider than the abacus of the capital.



The Romanesque and Gothic capitals throughout Europe present as much variety as in the Byzantine and for the same reason, that the artist evolved his conception of the design trom the block he was carving, but in these styles it goes further, on account of the clustering of columns and piers.



The earliest type of capital in Lombardy and Germany is that which is known as the cushion-cap, in which the lower portion of the cube block has been cut away to meet the circular shaft. These early types were generally painted at first with various geometrical designs, afterwards carved.



In Byzantine capitals, the eagle, the lion and the lamb are occasionally carved, but treated conventionally.  In England and France, the figures introduced into the capitals are sometimes full of character. These capitals, however, are not equal to those of the Early English school, in which the foliage is conventionally treated as if it had been copied from metalwork, and is of infinite variety, being found in small village churches as well as in cathedrals.



Renaissance and post-Renaissance capitals.

In the Renaissance period the feature became of the greatest importance and its variety almost as great as in the Byzantine and Gothic styles. The flat pilaster, which was employed so extensively in the Renaissance, called for a planar rendition of the capital, executed in high relief. This affected the designs of capitals. A traditional 15th century Early Renaissance variant of the Composite capital turns the volutes inwards above stiffened leaf carving. In new Renaissance combinations in capital designs, most of the ornament can be traced to Roman sources.



The Renaissance was as much a reinterpretation as a revival of Classical norms. The volutes of Greek and Roman Ionic capitals lie in the same plane as the architrave above them. This may create an awkward transition at the corner, where, for example, the designer of the Temple of Athena Nike on the Acropolis, brought the outside volute of the end capitals forward at a 45-degree angle. The problem was more satisfactorily solved by the 16th century Renaissance architect Sebastiano Serlio, who angled outwards all the volutes of his Ionic capitals. Since then, the use of antique Ionic capitals, instead of Serlio's version, has tended to lend an archaic air to the entire context, as in Greek Revival.



Within the bounds of decorum, a certain amount of inventive play has always been acceptable within the classical tradition. When Benjamin Latrobe redesigned the Senate Vestibule in the United States Capitol in 1807, he introduced six columns that he 'Americanized' with ears of corn (maize) substituting for the European acanthus leaves. As Latrobe reported to Thomas Jefferson in August 1809,

""These capitals during the summer session obtained me more applause from members of Congress than all the works of magnitude or difficulty that surround them. They christened them the 'corncob capitals'."";

After leading 31-17 in the fourth quarter, Miami held on for a 31-30 victory.  Nebraska pulled to within one with :48 left to play, but a two-point conversion attempt by Nebraska failed when quarterback Turner Gill's pass was tipped away by Miami safety Ken Calhoun. The win gave Miami its first national championship.



The Osborne decision.

Nebraska coach Tom Osborne made a particularly memorable call, a trick play later named the fumblerooski at a score of 17-0 for Miami. However, the match became a textbook case in game theory because of Osborne's call for a two-point conversion in the closing minutes which his team could not execute, leading to the one-point loss. A simple extra point conversion would have tied the game and arguably given Nebraska the national championship. Avinash Dixit and Barry Nalebuff note that the coach's fault was not in not going for the tie, but in not looking ahead earlier: ""Tom Osborne would have done better to first try the two-point attempt (at the score of 31-23), and then if it succeeded go for the one-point, while if it failed attempt a second two-pointer."" Dixit and Nalebuff offer the example as a case of faulty decision making under uncertainty.

3610684,Mu Beta Psi,"Mu Beta Psi National Honorary Musical Fraternity is a service and music fraternity with chapters and colonies at universities throughout the United States. Founded in 1925 at North Carolina State University by the director of bands, Major Percy Walter ""Daddy"" Price, this group began as a male-only, honor fraternity for band students.  However, it soon spread to a number of colleges throughout the southern United States and allowed women to join the group in the early 1960s.  By the early 2000s, the fraternity had spread to several colleges through the eastern United States, both in the north and south.



Although the name contains National Honorary Musical Fraternity, Mu Beta Psi views itself as primarily a music service group.  Several of the chapters run scholarship programs and pride themselves on giving service to their music departments.  



 Active chapters .

The chapters were named in order of their acceptance to Mu Beta Psi.







In addition, Mu Beta Psi has an Alumni Association that is considered an active chapter.  The Alumni Association is open to alumni of all Mu Beta Psi chapters, active or otherwise.

520975,Ralph Bellamy,"Ralph Rexford Bellamy (June 17, 1904   November 29, 1991) was a Tony Award-winning American actor with a career spanning sixty-two years. 



Bellamy was born in Chicago, Illinois. He began his acting career on stage, and by 1927 owned his own theatre company. In 1931 he made his film debut and worked constantly throughout the thirties, establishing himself as a capable supporting actor.  Bellamy received the lead role in the 1936 film Straight from the Shoulder.  He then received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Awful Truth (1937) opposite Irene Dunne and Cary Grant and played a similar part (the naive, aw-shucks boyfriend competing with the sophisticated light-comedy Grant character) in His Girl Friday (1940). He portrayed detective Ellery Queen in a few films during the forties, but as his film career had not progressed, he returned to the stage, where he continued to perform throughout the fifties.



Highly regarded within the industry, he served four years as President of Actor's Equity.



Bellamy was a regular panelist on the television game show To Tell the Truth during its initial run.



On Broadway he appeared in one of his most famous roles, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello. He later starred in the 1960 film version. 



On film, he also starred in Rosemary's Baby (1968) as a sweet talking but devilish physician, before turning to television during the seventies.  An Emmy Award nomination for the mini-series The Winds of War (1983), in which Bellamy reprised his Sunrise at Campobello role of Franklin Roosevelt, and a role as a conniving billionaire alongside Don Ameche in Trading Places (also 1983) brought him back into the limelight.



In 1984 he was presented with a Life Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild, and in 1987 received an Honorary Academy Award ""for his unique artistry and his distinguished service to the profession of acting.""



Among his later roles was a memorable appearance as a once-brilliant but incresingly forgetful lawyer sadly skewered by the Jimmy Smits character on an episode of L.A. Law.



He continued working regularly and gave his final performance in Pretty Woman (1990).



He died as a result of a lung ailment in Santa Monica, California at the age of 87, and was buried in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.



Bellamy has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6542 Hollywood Boulevard.

489752,Geneviève Bujold,"Geneviève Bujold (born July 1, 1942 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian actress.



Related to 19th century Quebec strongman/weightlifter Louis Cyr, Bujold was raised by strict Roman Catholic French-Canadian parents who sent her to a convent school for her full twelve years of education. She disliked the school and its strict discipline, and eventually left it to pursue an acting career.



Dramatically trained at Montreal's Conservatory of Dramatic Art, she got her big break while on tour with a theatrical company in Paris, France when French director Alain Resnais selected her for a role opposite Yves Montand in La Guerre est finie (1966). This led to her staying in France for a time where she made more films with noted French directors such as Louis Malle.



Bujold appeared in a variety of film roles for Canadian and U.S. television earning a 1967 Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Joan of Arc in an NBC ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" presentation. That year, she married Canadian film director Paul Almond, who directed her in Isabel (1968), and Act of the Heart (1970), opposite Donald Sutherland. They had a son Matthew in 1968 and were divorced in 1972. Also in 1968, she won the Prix Suzanne Bianchetti as the most promising young actress in French film.



In 1969, she starred opposite Richard Burton in the film, Anne of the Thousand Days. For her powerful performance, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a motion-picture drama as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.



Her considerable acting skills had the media touting her to become one of the brightest stars but Bujold's temperament led to run-ins with her employer Universal Studios and she walked away from her contract, resulting in a lawsuit (which was settled when she agreed to appear in the 1974 disaster film Earthquake). In the ensuing years she gave many sterling performances (in films such as The Trojan Women (1971, opposite Katharine Hepburn and Vanessa Redgrave), Kamouraska (1973), Brian De Palma's Obsession (1976), Alex and the Gypsy (1976, opposite Jack Lemmon), the medical thriller Coma (1978, opposite Michael Douglas), Choose Me (1984, directed by Alan Rudolph) and Tightrope (1984, directed by Clint Eastwood), but never reached the heights of movie stardom which many believed to be her due. She won the Best Actress in a Leading Role Genie Award for Murder by Decree (1979).



In 1994, she signed on to play the lead character, Captain Nicole Janeway, in the American television series Star Trek: Voyager. However she dropped out after filming just a few scenes of the series' first episode, stating that a TV series work schedule was too demanding. Kate Mulgrew replaced her and the character's name was changed to Kathryn Janeway.



Bujold   who spent several years away from her acting career after giving birth to a second son in 1980 (she re-emerged in the 1984 Alan Rudolph film Choose Me)   continues to work in film, primarily with independent production companies.

6983089,The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid,"The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid is a 1982 collection of two science fiction novels by L. Sprague de Camp. Both works are part of his Viagens Interplanetarias series and of its subseries of stories set on the fictional planet Krishna. The collection was first published in paperback by Ace Books in 1982. It was issued as the fourth volume of the standard edition of the Krishna novels, and its component parts were at the time of publication the fourth and fifth Krishna novels, chronologically. Afterwards, publication of The Prisoner of Zhamanak (1982) and The Bones of Zora (1983) made them the fifth and seventh Krishna novels, respectively.





Contents:

The Virgin of Zesh;

The Tower of Zanid;



 Setting .

The planet Krishna is de Camp's premier creation in the Sword and Planet genre, representing both a tribute to the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and an attempt to ""get it right"", reconstructing the concept logically, without what he regarded as Burroughs' biological and technological absurdities.



 Trivia .

The titles of all of de Camp's ""Krishna"" novels have a ""Z"" in them, a practice he claimed to have devised to keep track of them. Short stories in the series do not follow the practice, nor do Viagens Interplanetarias works not set on Krishna."

 eFilmCritic.com interview with Barry Pepper about ""Flags of Our Fathers"";"
4717457,Liljana Bishop,"Liljana 'Lil' Bishop (née Ristic) was a fictional character in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Marcella Russo. She first appeared in 2003 and remained in the show until her presumed death in 2005 following the Neighbours plane crash.

 

Of Serbian descent, Lilijana grew up under the dominant shadow of her mother Svetlanka Ristic and lived in Perth, Western Australia, surrounded by her family. However, her parents were less than pleased when she married Australian born David Bishop aged only 19, but their marriage seemed to be a success and the two had a daughter named Serena.



After David was offered a job in Erinsborough the whole family moved where they thought they would be living in their newly built house in Eden Hills. Yet having invested all their savings into a business that appeared to have gone bust David almost bankrupt the family and instead of furthering her education, Lil was forced to get a job as a receptionist for Karl Kennedy. 



Things gradually got worse for the family after Serena was involved with a paedophile, Chris Cousens, whom Lil promptly slapped, and David's job meant he was away a lot. The Bishop family's lot was even worse when wicked Svetlanka turned up and after a heated argument revealed that Lil had been pregnant and that was why she married David. She had found herself pregnant to Ivan Petrovich, a worker at the family vineyard. Ivan fled the scene, so when David came along to help the family with their accounts, Lil quickly saw him as a potential father for her child. But Lil was led to believe that the child was stillborn, and she never even saw it for 19 years. 



Meanwhile, Serena had made friends with a young Serbian friend named Luka, her grandmother's godson, and the two started a relationship.  However, she was at the time unaware that Luka was her long lost half-brother, whom Svetlanka had kept away from the rest of her family for 19 years.



Lil suffered from acute liver failure and needed part of a family member's liver to survive.  It was revealed that Luka would be able to save her. Upon returning to good health, Svetlanka was promptly thrown out by her daughter while Luka later decided to return to his adoptive parents. It was then that Lil was offered a job with Paul Robinson as manager of the Helen Daniels Trust.



Yet the marriage soured after David became obsessed with his work and Lil had an affair with Paul. Only when Paul was revealed to be plottong to destroy Erinsborough did Lil finally return to her husband.



As the family's luck was finally starting to get better they all boarded a plane to Tasmania to celebrate the re-opening of Lassiters' by going to a casino and hotel. Before the plane was boarded, a person, later revealed to be Paul's son, Robert, planted a bomb on the plane that exploded in flight.  David, Lilijana and Serena hugged one another as the plane crashed into the Bass Strait.  David was confirmed dead, but Lil and Serena's bodies were not found.



At her and Serena's memorial service (only David's body was recovered) Susan Smith said the following:



""Lil had a spectacularly short fuse, which was matched only by her sense of humour. But I think it was her passionate love affair with life that made her such  such a wonderful friend. That and her cooking. But always to Lil, the most important thing was family. I hope they re together now and I hope they remain in peace forever""



She appeared on the show between 2003 and 2005. The Bishop family were axed, which proved most unpopular with fans and the actor who played David's father Harold Bishop, Ian Smith.



 Trivia .



Lilijana slapped two people on the show, both in defense of her daughter, Carmella Cammenetti and Chris Cousens.



She was able to read coffee grounds, and before they left for the tragic plane journey she informed David that it looked as though he had no future, as all the grounds were gone. ;



She usually called Harold 'Tata', a common Eastern European greeting for an older male relative.



Lil was best friends with Susan and Lyn, but following her death neither woman seemed particualry distraught.



Her mother Svetlanka was apparently too upset to go to the memorial service and was apparently ill in bed and on medication.



Luka Dokic, Lil's long-lost-son who she had recently reunited with did not come to her funeral;

Liljana Ristic, had a relationship with Ivan Petrovich (deceased),married to David Bishop (deceased);

1155826,Penny Hedge,"The Penny Hedge legend dates back to 1159. It is a legend and tradition in the English town of Whitby in Yorkshire.



The Abbot of Whitby imposed a penance on three hunters, and on their descendants for all time, for murdering a hermit at Eskdaleside.



On the shore, they had to construct a short hedge from stakes woven together. The instructions stipulated that a knife of a penny price is to be used.



The ceremony is still performed in Whitby every year on the eve of Ascension Day.

1278543,Henry Cort,"Henry Cort (1740   1800) was an English ironmaster.  During the Industrial Revolution in England, Cort began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron using innovative production systems. In 1782 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore.  The The Henry Cort Community College bears his name, located in the large town of Fareham, south of Funtley.  



Early Life.

The son of a builder, Cort was born in Lancaster in 1740. As a young man, he worked as a Royal Navy agent in London, where his interest in the poor quality of English iron against overseas supplies developed, leading to his inventions that greatly increased the quality of iron production.  He left his job as an agent in 1775.  His 1768 marriage to Elizabeth Heysham had connected him to the Attwick family of Gosport, and to Elizabeth's uncle, William Attwick.  Cort joined Attwick in the family iron business, living and working in Gosport.



Commerce, Innovation, and Ruin.

With an increase in demand for iron goods from the Royal Navy, the ironworking enterprise in Middle Street, Gosport flourished, but was severely strained by a 1779 contract for barrel hoops.  To cope with an unexpectedly high demand, and beset by the high cost of Swedish iron, Cort set up an iron works in Fontley, Hampshire.  This was a rolling mill, and here he developed his ideas, leading to patents in 1783 for the steam-powered grooved rolling process and 1784 for his balling or pudding furnace, allowing the manufacture of crude, standardized shapes.  His work built on the existing ideas of the Cranege brothers and their reverberatory furnace (where the heat is applied from above, rather than forced air from below) and Peter Onions' puddling process where the iron is stirred to separate out impurities and extract the higher quality wrought iron.  The ""puddler"" extracts a mass of iron from the furnace using a rabbling bar.  The extracted ball of metal is then processed into a shingle by a shingling hammer, after which it is rolled in a rolling mill.  



His partnership in the Fontley Mill was with Samuel Jellicoe (son of Adam Jellicoe, who had important Navy connections).  This eventually turned out very badly, but initially the elder Jellicoe financed Cort's experimentation with large sums and a wharf at Gosport was purchased.  On Adam Jellicoe's death (1789), he was in debt himself, and Cort's debts (guaranteed by his patents) to Jellicoe were called in to settle the estate.  Because of the nature of the business, which was now vital to the supply of iron to the Navy, the patents were taken over by the Government.  The younger Jellicoe was given sole control of the mill and wharf.  Royalties on the patents were not recovered (which might have cleared Cort's debts) and so Cort's impoverishment was settled.  



He married twice.  A short-lived marriage to Elizabeth Brown was succeeded by his marriage in 1768 to Elizabeth Heysham, with whom he had a large family.  However, his business ventures did not bring him wealth, even though vast numbers of the furnaces that he developed were eventually used (reportedly 8,200 by 1820).  He was awarded a government pension after leaving his firm, but died a ruined man, and was buried in Hampstead churchyard.

Biographical timeline.

1968 - born in Watertown, South Dakota;

1992 - received Bachelor of Science in biology from University of Colorado at Boulder, hired as a Research Associate by NeXstar (since bought out by Gilead);

1995 - hired by TSR, Inc. (originally Tactical Studies Rules), the Dungeons & Dragons company, relocated to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin ;

1997 - hired by Wizards of the Coast, relocated to Seattle;



Roleplaying work.

Bruce Cordell's RPG work includes many scenarios and sourcebooks; many of which are directly or indirectly concerned with monsters of a Lovecraftian bent (particularly mind flayers and psionics.



Cordell frequently references certain characters, ideas, and organizations repeatedly in his RPG works, creating a personal continuity between various supplements. For example, The Illithiad references the character of Strom Wakeman and the organization known as the Arcane Order. Wakeman was quoted occasionally in Planescape books by Cordell, such as A Guide to the Ethereal Plane, and was instrumental to the course of events in the adventure Dawn of the Overmind (books which were themselves also connected through a phenomenon called an ether gap). Meanwhile, the Arcane Order returned in Tome and Blood as a detailed organization and the basis of a prestige class.



Most of Cordell's work for Malhavoc Press has followed similar patterns, creating a sort of story arc across When the Sky Falls, If Thoughts Could Kill, and Hyperconscious, connected by the god-like Dark Plea and, to a lesser extent, the kureshim race. In an interview with Monte Cook, Cordell himself described his style as including ""subtle story threads that connect seemingly unrelated projects"".

1534301,Rolling pin,"A rolling pin is a cylindrical food preparation utensil used to shape and flatten dough. Two styles of rolling pins are found; roller and rods. Roller types consists of a thick cylindrical roller with small handles at each end; rod type rolling pins are usually thin tapered batons. Rolling pins of different styles and materials offer advantages over another, as they are used for different tasks in cooking and baking.



Types of rolling pins.

Rod: Thin rods typically made of wood around 2-3 cm in diameter. They are used by rolling the rod across the dough using one's palm. The pins may be tapered at one or both ends for more pivot control in certain tasks such as making small jiaozi skins or pie shells. Most East Asian or French style rolling pins, and the Turkish Oklava are rod style.

Roller: Consists of a thick heavy roller made of a variety of materials around 7-10 cm in diameter with thinner handles which extend through the roller. They are used by grasping the handles and pushing the pin across the dough. Many Western rolling pins are roller types.



Material.

Rolling pins come in a variety of sizes, shapes and materials including glass, wood, stainless steel, marble, and plastic. Some are hollow and are able to be filled with cold or warm water to better roll a desired food. Marble rolling pins are often cooled in a refrigerator for maintaining a cold dough while making puff pastry.



In popular culture.

Rolling pins are the stereotypical weapon of angry housewives and are frequently employed in cartoons as an instrument for inflicting cranial injury. According to some cookbooks, heavy wooden roller type rolling pins are best used on kitchen helpers when frustrated, and not on dough.

 Some special dice are also denoted rolling pins.

He was most noted for his victory in the Battle of Mount Dingjun, in which his force routed that of Xiahou Yuan, who was slain in the battle. For his merits, Huang Zhong was ranked among the five leading generals of Shu, later popularized as the Five Tiger Generals.



Huang Zhong had always been portrayed in popular literature and arts as an elderly general with youthful vigor and constitution. Even now, the spirit to strive for excellence despite old age is often attributed to him. However, little was documented about him in historical records and it is impossible to tell how old he was when he was named one of the Five Tiger Generals.



Life.



Born in Nanyang Commandery (present day Nanyang, Henan), Huang Zhong initially served a military post under Liu Biao, governor of Jingzhou (  ). After Liu Biao's death in 208, the powerful warlord Cao Cao conquered Jingzhou and Huang Zhong continued his service under this new lord of the land, specifically in Changsha under the city governor Han Xuan (  ).



Following Cao Cao's defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the same year, Liu Bei was gradually taking over the various commanderies in southern Jingzhou, including Changsha. Huang Zhong then began his service under Liu Bei. He performed extremely well in Liu Bei's campaign to gain Yizhou (  ) from 212 to 214, his bravery in battles unmatched by any. After Yizhou was taken, Huang Zhong was promoted to General who Campaigns against Rebels (    ).



In 217, Liu Bei led a force upon Hanzhong, which was under the control of Cao Cao. His force met with resistance led by Xiahou Yuan at Yangping Pass (   ). The confrontation dragged on for more than a year until one night, Liu Bei set fire to the barbed fence around Xiahou Yuan's camp at the foot of Mount Dingjun (   ). Alarmed by the attack, Xiahou Yuan sent Zhang He to defend the eastern corner of the camp, while he guarded the south. Liu Bei's main force pressed against Zhang He, outmatching the latter. Xiahou Yuan had to dispatch a fraction of his own troops to Zhang He's rescue.



Accompanied by thundering drums, the division led by Huang Zhong then descended upon Xiahou Yuan's dwindling force. The battle became a rout and Xiahou Yuan himself was killed in battle. The victory at Mount Dingjun was a major stepping stone to the later conquest of Hanzhong.



In 219, Liu Bei proclaimed himself King of Hanzhong and effectively the first emperor of the Kingdom of Shu. He then promoted Huang Zhong to General of the Rear (   ), placing the latter on the same level as four other veteran generals: Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Zhao Yun. However, Huang Zhong died in the next year, to an unspecified cause. He was given the posthumous title of Marquis Gang, literally meaning the unyielding marquis.



Huang Zhong in Romance of the Three Kingdoms.



The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a historical novel by Luo Guanzhong, was a romanticization of the events that occurred before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Huang Zhong was portrayed as an aged but extremely talented warrior, excelling especially in archery. He was also credited with the slaying of Xiahou Yuan, a prominent general of the Kingdom of Wei, in the Battle of Mount Dingjun, though in reality the latter was most probably killed in the rush of enemy soldiers.



Battle of Mount Dingjun.





In Chapter 71, Xiahou Yuan stationed his troops on Mount Dingjun and effectively resisted the advance of Huang Zhong. Under the council of advisor Fa Zheng, Huang Zhong occupied Mount Tiandang (   ), a taller peak that lied to the west of Mount Dingjun. From this new vantage point Huang Zhong had an excellent view of Xiahou Yuan's troop movements.



Xiahou Yuan could not tolerate his enemy spying on him and insisted on attacking Mount Tiandang. Setting out his troops to surround Mount Tiandang, Xiahou Yuan rode forth and challenged his enemy to battle. However, Huang Zhong kept his troops back and refused to engage.



In the afternoon, Fa Zheng saw from his lookout post near the peak that Xiahou Yuan's troops had grown tired and dispirited. He then hoisted a red flag, signalling Huang Zhong to attack. Amid deafening drums and war horns, the Shu troops rushed downhill with Huang Zhong galloping in the forefront. Before he could react, Xiahou Yuan was cleft in two below his shoulders by Huang Zhong. With their commander dead, the Wei soldiers were easily defeated and Mount Dingjun was felled.



Battle outside Luocheng.

Prior to the Battle of Mount Dingjun, before Liu Bei had even gained Yizhou (  ), Luo Guanzhong created a fictional battle in which Huang Zhong competed with his colleague Wei Yan for credits. In Chapter 62, Liu Bei's main force was approaching Luocheng (  ), a strategic city which would allow further advances on Chengdu, capital of Yizhou.



The enemy had established two camps sixty li outside the city, one under Ling Bao (  ) and the other under Deng Xian (  ). Huang Zhong had volunteered to lead a vanguard force to vanquish both camps, which Liu Bei approved, when Wei Yan voiced his doubts over the aged Huang Zhong's physical ability. This infuriated Huang Zhong, who challenged Wei Yan to a duel. To appease both, Liu Bei then ordered Huang Zhong to attack Ling Bao and Wei Yan to strike Deng Xian.



Wanting all credits for himself, Wei Yan set out his troops early next morning and headed for Ling Bao's camp instead. However, Ling Bao was ready for the attack and used a flanking tactic on the enemy. Wei Yan's troops, exhausted after a long march, were overpowered and began to retreat. Wei Yan's horse stumbled, throwing its rider off. A force led by Deng Xian had by then arrived, and its commander came straight for Wei Yan with his spear held forth.



Just then, an arrow knocked Deng Xian off in mid-gallop. So it was that Huang Zhong had come to the rescue. Having slain the fallen Deng Xian, Huang Zhong then went for Ling Bao, brandishing his sword. Ling Bao was no match for his ferocious foe and had to retreat. However, his camp was already taken over by Liu Bei's main force. In his frantic attempt to find an escape, Ling Bao was ambushed and captured by Wei Yan, who had regrouped his force in a bid to redeem himself. For the victory, Huang Zhong was heavily rewarded while Wei Yan was pardoned for his disobedience.



Death.

The events leading up to Huang Zhong's death in Chapter 83 were probably fictitious as well. Luo Guangzhong wrote that in 222, Huang Zhong followed Liu Bei on a campaign against the Kingdom of Wu. One day, hearing that Liu Bei commented on aged and incapable generals, Huang Zhong mounted his horse and rode straight to the forward camp.



Just at this time, an enemy vanguard force had arrived. Huang Zhong insisted on meeting the enemies. Holding his sword ready, the old general challenged for a duel with the enemy commander Pan Zhang (  ). Pan Zhang sent out his aide Shi Ji (  ), who was slain by Huang Zhong within three bouts.



Brandishing the late Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade, Pan Zhang then rode forward to meet Huang Zhong. Neither could establish a clear advantage but Huang Zhong was fighting with all his might. Not expecting to win the battle, Pan Zhang then retreated.



The next day, Pan Zhang rode out to issue challenge for another duel, which Huang Zhong eagerly took up. Within bouts, however, Pan Zhang turned to escape. Huang Zhong gave pursuit without hesitation. It was in fact a plot by the enemy, who had ambushed in wait for Huang Zhong. Running right into the trap, Huang Zhong was struck beneath the collar bone by an arrow fired by Ma Zhong (  ) and almost fell off his horse.



Fortunately, a friendly force led by Guan Xing and Zhang Bao (  ) came to the rescue and brought back Huang Zhong. Liu Bei came personally to the forward camp to see the injured general, but Huang Zhong was too old and weak to survive the arrow wound. He died the same night in camp, at the age of seventy-five.



Modern references.



Huang Zhong is a playable character in the Koei video game series Dynasty Warriors.  Huang is depicted as a wise and honourable elderly man whom younger officers, such as Zhao Yun, respect and look to for guidance. always eager to prove to friend and foe alike that he is still a very capable officer and combatant.  His weapon of choice is a large and elaborate saber he calls the ""Oracle Sword,"" although his prowess with a bow features largely into his cinematic sequences and conversations.



The Battle of Mt. Ding Jun is Huang's shining moment.  Leading his unit into battle against the defending Cao Wei army, Huang personally slays Xiahou Yuan in almost every release in which he appears.  He will usually compliment Xiahou's skill, but will refuse to spare his life, due to the level of arrogance and disdain with which he treats his opposition.  Although his relationship with other officers is not as strong as other characters, he is shown to have ties to Wei Yan, as the two served together before entering Liu Bei's service. He is also shown to have a good relationship with Yan Yan, who constantly serves as Huang's second-in-command. Apart from his long, grey beard, Huang is usually depicted as appearing youthful for his age.  He generally wears light armour consisting  of steel and leather over cloth, commonly worn by cavalry archers and other frontline fighters who rely on agility and swift movement during battle.  This is sometimes accompanied by flowing, green and gold robes to add a unique style to his appearance.

Each season, member schools participate on the basketball tournament. The tournament consists of four rounds. The first two rounds are the elimination rounds, where the top four teams advance to the semi-finals. The two best teams among the Final Four earns a twice to beat advantage, while the other two only needs to be beaten once in order to be eliminated.



The surviving teams from the semi-finals qualify for the best-of-three Finals series, where the first team to notch two wins would be awarded with the championship trophy.



All of the games of the tournament are said to be held on neutral venues, that is outside campuses of the competing schools.









List of champions per year.

The school that wins both the Juniors and Seniors tournament in the same season are ""double champions"" and are denoted in bold.



Early years (1924-1935).

The NCAA was founded by the Ateneo de Manila, De La Salle College, the Institute of Accounts (known today as Far Eastern University), National University, San Beda College, the University of Manila, the University of the Philippines, Manila and the University of Santo Tomas. Membership was liquid, and the composition of the league changed frequently.





The old-timer six (1936-68).

After National University, University of the Philippines, Manila, and University of Santo Tomas left the league, the Ateneo de Manila, Colegio de San Juan de Letran, De La Salle College, José Rizal College, Mapúa Institute of Technology and San Beda College continued the league and the league's membership remained unchanged for several decades.



World War II interrupted the league's activities in 1941, but the league resumed operations after the war in 1947.





First expansion (1969-78).

San Sebastian College - Recoletos was admitted in 1969, marking the first change in the league's membership since 1936.





First contraction (1978-84).

The Ateneo de Manila University left the league in 1978 due to the violence that had become rampant in the games.



De La Salle University, on the other hand, left the league in 1981 after a violence-filled 1980 game against Letran.



San Beda College left in 1984 to concentrate on intramural events.





Second expansion (1984-95).

After the Ateneo de Manila, La Salle, and San Beda left, the NCAA opened its doors to new members. In 1984, Perpetual Help College of Rizal was accepted as a new member, while Trinity College of Quezon City became a full member on 1985.



San Beda rejoined the league in 1986, the year Trinity was dropped from the league due to non-compliance of league requirements.





Third expansion (1996-present).

In 1996, Philippine Christian University became the seventh member of the NCAA. Three years later, De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde was admitted as the eighth member. 





Notes.

 The Juniors tournament was suspended from 1961 to 1965 by the NCAA Board of Control when it was revealed when several schools fielded ineligible players.



 Seniors championships awarded on the 1963-64 and 1964-65 seasons were later ruled as unofficial by the NCAA.



 Colegio de San Juan de Letran returned the Juniors trophy after a player was found to be ineligible.

923028,Declaration of Rights of Peoples of Russia,"The Declaration of Rights of Peoples of Russia (                                 ) was a document promulgated by the Bolshevik government of Russia on November 15 (November 2 by Old Style), 1917 (signed by Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin).



The document proclaimed:



 Equality and sovereignty of peoples of Russia;

 Right of peoples of Russia  of a free self-determination, including secession and formation of a separate state;

 Abolition of all national and religious privileges and restrictions;

 Free development of national minorities and ethnographical groups populating the territory of Russia.



The meaning of the Declaration is still disputed in Russian historiography. In 1917 the Bolshevist thinking was still largely idealistic, dominated by vague ideas of ""universal happiness"". Also, at that moment Bolsheviks believed that the World revolution was imminent, so they did not care much about loss of territories. 



However, it is often argued that in fact Lenin and Stalin agreed to liberate mostly the territories they had no sovereignty upon since Russia had lost them to Central Powers in 1915 and 1916. Many historians suggest that the purpose of the document was to limit the public dissent after Russia lost most of its western areas and try to complicate the matters behind the front lines. 



The declaration had the effect of rallying some of ethnic non-Russians behind Bolsheviks. Latvian riflemen were important supporters of Bolsheviks in the early days of Russian Civil War and Latvian historians recognize the promise of sovereignty as an important reason for that. White Russians did not support self-determination and, as a result, few Latvians fought on the White side.



The right of secession was soon exercised by many nations that earlier had been incorporated into Imperial Russia. Many areas in Russia itself were also declared independent republics. Bolshevist Russia would, however, attempt to establish Soviet power in as many of those as possible. All three Baltic states experienced wars between Soviet governments aiming to establish a Communist state allied with Bolshevist Russia and non-Communist governments aiming for an independent state. The Soviet governments would receive a direct military support from Russia. After the non-Communist side winning, Russia recognized them as the legitimate governments of Baltic states in 1920.



Russian historiography often cited the document as one of the main bases for the liberation of Central European states. However, it is to be noted that Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus and Estonia were either created as puppet states by the Central Powers or liberated by the nations of the abovementioned countries themselves after the collapse of Germany and Austria-Hungary.



 List of seceded lands .

The following countries declared their independence late after the Bolsheviks' declaration, establishing themselves as non-Communist states. Although the role this declaration played for their declared independence is doubtful, it eased Bolshevist Russia's recognition of their independence. Note that except for Finland, all of these areas were outside of Russian sovereignty following the Austro-German successes in the Great War and were officially ceded in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. 



 Ukrainian People's Republic (autonomy November 22, 1917, independence January 22, 1918);

 Moldova (December 2, 1917   joined Romania in 1918);

 Finland (December 6, 1917);

 Lithuania (December 11, 1917);

 Estonia (February 24, 1918);

 Poland (November 11, 1918);

 Latvia (November 18, 1918);

 Belarus (March 25, 1918);



(exact dates need correction)



These countries declared their independence, as Communist states, soon after the declaration:



 Transcaucasia (April 22, 1918);

 Tuva (June 1918);

 Belarus;



Several other independent republics have been proclaimed but happened to be short-lived:



 Kazan;

 Kaluga ;

 Ryazan;

 Ufa;

 Bashkiria;

 Orenburg;



Later developments.

Bolsheviks have never rejected the idea of self-determination, still the Soviet Constitutions (of 1924, 1936 and 1977) limited the right of secession to the constituent republics only. However, in 1990 Lithuania declared its indepence again, citing their right to secession as written down in Soviet Constitution."

7806450,Liquid State Machine,"A Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a computational construct, like a neural network. An LSM consists of a large collection of units (called nodes, or neurons). Each node receives time varying input from external sources (the inputs) as well as other nodes. Nodes are randomly connected to each other. The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes. The spatio-temporal patterns of activation are read out by linear discriminant units.



The soup of recurrently connected nodes will end up computing a large variety of nonlinear functions on the input. Given a large enough variety of such nonlinear functions, it is theoretically possible to obtain linear combinations (using the read out units) to perform whatever mathematical operation is needed to perform a certain task, such as speech recognition or computer vision.



The word liquid in the name comes from the analogy drawn to dropping a stone into a still body of water or other liquid. The falling stone will generate ripples in the liquid. The input (motion of the falling stone) has been converted into a spatio-temporal pattern of liquid displacement (ripples).



LSMs have been put forward as a way to explain the operation of brains. LSMs are argued to be an improvement over the theory of artificial neural networks because:





Circuits are not hand coded to perform a specific task.

Continuous time inputs are handled ""naturally"".

Computations on various time scales can be done using the same network.

The same network can perform multiple computations.





Criticisms of LSMs as used in computational neuroscience are that



LSMs don't actually explain how the brain functions. At best they can replicate some parts of brain functionality.

There is no guaranteed way to dissect a working network and figure out how or what computations are being performed.

Very little control over the process. 

Inefficient from an implementation point of view because they require lots of computations, compared to custom designed circuits, or even neural networks.

125983,"Las Vegas, New Mexico","Las Vegas is a city in San Miguel County, New Mexico,  United States. Once two separate towns, West Las Vegas (""Old Town"") and East Las Vegas (""New Town""), divided by the Gallinas River, retain distinct characters and separate, rival, school districts. The population was 14,565 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of San Miguel County.



Las Vegas is the home of New Mexico Highlands University. It is also a venue used by the IBNA for teacher training, perhaps due to the proximity of the Armand Hammer United World College of the American West.



Las Vegas is sometimes mistaken for Las Vegas, Nevada.  



History.

Las Vegas was established in 1835 after a group of settlers received a land grant from the Mexican government. The town was laid out in the traditional Spanish Colonial style, with a central plaza surrounded by buildings which could serve as fortifications in case of attack. Las Vegas soon prospered as a stop on the Santa Fe Trail. During the Mexican-American War in 1846, Stephen W. Kearny delivered an address at the Plaza of Las Vegas claiming New Mexico for the United States.



When the railroad arrived in 1880 it set up shop one mile east of the Plaza, creating a separate, rival New Town (as in Albuquerque). During the railroad era Las Vegas boomed, quickly becoming one of the largest cities in the American southwest. Turn-of-the-century Las Vegas featured all the modern amenities, including an electric street railway, the ""Duncan Opera House"" at the NE corner of 6th Street and Douglas Avenue, a Carnegie library, a major Harvey House hotel, and the New Mexico Normal School (now NMHU). Since the decline of the railroad began in the 1950s the city's population has remained relatively constant.



Geography.



Las Vegas is located at  (35.597031, -105.222589).



According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 19.5 km² (7.5 mi²), all land.

There were 5,588 households out of which 33.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.0% were married couples living together, 21.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.3% were non-families. 30.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 3.08.



In the city the population was spread out with 26.4% under the age of 18, 13.3% from 18 to 24, 26.2% from 25 to 44, 21.2% from 45 to 64, and 12.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 90.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.2 males.

Many silent Western films were made in and around Las Vegas, especially in the years 1913-1915, including a number that starred Tom Mix. 



In the 1969 movie Easy Rider, Las Vegas, NM is the town where the two bikers ride behind a parade, are arrested for ""parading without a permit,"" and meet Jack Nicholson's character in jail. The town name can be seen in the background in one scene during this part of the movie.



The town was the filming location for parts of the 1978 movie Convoy, a film about truck drivers inspired by the 1975 song of the same name.



Parts of The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez (1983) were filmed in and around Las Vegas.



Las Vegas was the real-world town used to represent the fictional setting of Calumet, Colorado in John Milius' 1984 film Red Dawn. As of 2005, many of the buildings and structures seen in the film remain.



Several scenes in the 1998 John Carpenter's Vampires were filmed in the plaza.



In the 2001 documentary Freedom Downtime, a cross-country road trip to Las Vegas, Nevada ends up in Las Vegas, New Mexico by mistake.



Las Vegas is also the hometown of producer Darren Martinez.



In 2006, the film Fanboys used Las Vegas as one of its film locations.  The film is about a dying Star Wars fan and will be released in 2007.  The upcoming movie The Astronaut Farmer, also a 2007 projected release, was also filmed here.

8295042,Kalduny/work,"Kalduny or kolduny (, ) is a  Belarusian dish, a kind of dumplings.  In Slavic languages the word means  magicians ,  sorcerers , however it is unclear how the word entered into the cuisine.



Some people maintain it came from the West (Germany or Czech Crown) in XV century (in medieval Latin calduna meant  still warm bowels of just killed animal , derived from calidus    warm) . But Belarusian Tatars who settled in the country in XIV-XV centuries, insist that Kalduny is the descendant of similar Tatar dish kundumy. These big kalduny are prepared for the major Moslem feasts, with lavishly spiced mutton or veal stuffing and are eaten by spoon so that dough wrapping is not broken (torn?) and not a single drop of delicious juice from inside is lost. Traditional Tartar kundumy were deep fried in a good amount of melted sheep fat.



Kalduny, dough dumplings with meat, mushroom or other stuffing are indeed related to similar dishes both in the West ad in the East, from Italian ravioli to Russian pelmeni and Uzbek manty.



Same as for many other dishes, Belarusians argue with Poles and Lithuanians for the priority of introducing kalduny into the cuisine of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The most famous are Kalduny a-la Count Tyshkevich invented in the XIX century by the old aristocratic Belarusian Tyshkevich (Tyszkiewicz) family, and this increases chances of Belarusians in the vigorous battle for heritage.Kalduny are made with smoked ham & mushroom stuffing and were long considered the country s  visiting card    although decades of Soviet-time oblivion almost erased their trace from the popular memory, and now they are served only in few local restaurants.



The simplest dough for kalduny is made of flour mixed with tepid water with some salt. But in the days of yore any decent gentry housewife had her own secret of dough: some added beaten eggs, some flax seed oil, some baking soda. Some maintain that the true dough for Kalduny should me mixed with onion juice, not water. Anyway, good dough for kalduny shall be soft but elastic, easy to strain and to glue. Well blended dough has to be wrapped into a clean serviette and left to cool and to  rest  for some time. When shaping your own kalduny, lay the ready ones on a clean surface strewn with flour and close the rest of the dough with a kitchen towel so that it don t dry out.



Kalduny may be both a main course and a dessert, depending on stuffing. For the latter meat, or fish, or farmer cheese, or dried fruit, may be used. Stuffing should be neither too  hard  nor too sticky   best if you can shape small 1 inch ball from it. It should not get between the 2 edges of the glued kalduny so that they do not disintegrate during cooking. The sauce with which kalduny are served also depends on stuffing. For  Vilnia  (Vilnius) stuffing melted butter is the best, while for  Russian  stuffing   thick sour cream, and fruit syrups   for the fruit stuffing.



Most kalduny are best when boiled in big shallow casserole at low heat in well-salted water, just some 5-6 minutes after surfacing. But some  species  can be baked, fried. Those in Polesian style, with stuffing of boiled river fish and hardboiled eggs are, for instance, deep-fried. Almost infinite number of combinations of dough, stuffing and sauce gives unlimited potential for the creativity which still mostly lay unclaimed: the country is dominated by Russian pelmeni and, partly, by the Ukrainian vareniki.

6328969,Isoko,"History.

Isoko is the name of one of the ethnic groups living in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria. The people fondly call themselves the ""Isoko nation"" or the ""Isoko people"". The Isoko area is located in the present Delta State of Nigeria. It used to be a part of the defunct ""Mid-West Region"" and then was part of ""Bendel State"", before Bendel State was split to form two new states: ""Edo"" and ""Delta"" states. The language spoken by the Isoko people is ""Isoko"". It is linguistically similar to that spoken by the neighboring Urhobo people. While some people believed that the Isoko people  originated from the Benin peoples, this is not true. Professor Obaro Ikime states ""If there is any aspect of the history of the various peoples of Nigeria about which no one can speak with any exactitude, it is that which deals with the origins of our peoples"" . The belief that most of the Isoko groups are of Benin origin were views held and expressed in the 1960s and 1970s. These views were ""decidedly simplistic and were based on British Intelligence Reports of the 1930s"" and Ikime's field work of 1961-1963.



Politics and Government.

With the creation of the present Delta State in Nigeria, 2 local government units were created in the Isoko. These are:

Isoko North  - The Isoko North Local Government Area has its headquarters at Ozoro;

Isoko South - The Isoko South Local Government Area has its headquarters at Oleh;

Economy.

The main economic activity is food crop farming. And the staple food crops include cassava and yams. There is also the widespread production of palm oil and palm kernels. Limited amount of hunting and fishing is also done. Women form a large proportion of the farming population. They also engage in trade of food crops for cash to meet other basic household needs. On market days, it is common to see Isoko women peddling their assorted goods around neighboring villages.



Cassava is the source of most of the foods consumed by the Isoko people. ""Garri"", starch meal (""Ozi""), ""Egu"" are cassava derivatives.



Food crop production has been declining rapidly recently. This has been largely attributed to soil damage resulting from frequent crude oil spills from pipelines belonging to some of the major oil producing companies (including Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), whose pipeline network transverse the landscape). This has led to large-scale frustrations with Shell Petroleum Development Company, and has resulted in skirmishes and, recently, kidnappings for ransom in some neighboring communities.



Demographics.

There is no definitive population census figure on the size of the Isoko people and, indeed, most of Nigeria. The various Nigerian census figures have been controversial and are deemed unsupportable.



Transport.

Popular mode of transport is the motorcycle and bicycle. Inter-city travel is by bus or car.





Education.

Several secondary schools and post-secondary schools exist in the region. The Isoko people know the value of education and encourage their young to attend school. The Isoko people have been known to be very passionate about location of education infrastructure in their communities, believing it is a mark of progress.  	 

 

Early emphasis was on teacher-training schools and this led to a glut of teachers in the community. This is rapidly changing as opportunities offered by other professions are recognized.



Major post-primary educational institutions in the region include Notre Dame College, Ozoro; James Welch Grammar School, Emevor; Saint Joseph's Teacher's College, Ozoro; Saint Michael's College Oleh; Bribina Grammar School, Ozoro, and several more. Post-secondary schools include a campus of the Delta State University at Oleh and a Polytechnic at Ozoro.



Society and Culture.

The language of the Isoko people is ""Isoko""



The Isoko people are predominantly Christians. Traditional idol worship still thrives despite the strong onslaught of Christian principles. ""Oghene"" means God.



Geography and Climate.

Location.

The Isoko region is located in Delta State of modern Nigeria. 



Local Climatic conditions.

Isoko region is in the tropical rain forest area of the Niger-delta. The region experiences high rainfall and high humidity most of the year. The climate is equatorial and is marked by two distinct seasons. The Dry and Rainy seasons. The Dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool ""harmarttan"" dusty haze from the north-east winds. The Rainy season spans May to October with a brief dry spell in August."

882510,Danny Blanchflower,"Robert Dennis ""Danny"" Blanchflower (born February 10, 1926 in Belfast, died December 9, 1993) was a footballer, football manager, and journalist who captained Spurs during their double-winning season of 1961.  He is remembered as one of the great tacticians in the history the game, renowned for his passing, as an outstanding right-half and as an thoroughly decent human being.

Early years.

Blanchflower was born in the Bloomfield district of Belfast, possibly inheriting some footballing ability from his mother, who had played as a centre-forward in a women's team. He was educated at Ravenscroft public elementary school and was awarded a scholarship to Belfast College of Technology. He left early to become an apprentice electrician at the Gallachers' cigarette factory. He also joined the air-raid precautions (ARP) and in 1943 lied about his age in order to join the RAF. As a trainee navigator he was sent on a course to St Andrews University (where he acquired a lifelong love of golf) and in the spring of 1945 was posted to Canada for further training. By 1946 he was back in Belfast, back at Gallachers, and building a reputation as an outstanding footballer.

Playing career.

He began his professional football career at the end of the Second World War when he was signed by Belfast side Glentoran. In 1949, Barnsley F.C. paid £6,000 to transfer him to England, and two years later Aston Villa bought him for £15,000. He played 155 times for Villa, captaining the side on many occasions. However, he became unhappy with the club and the way training was conducted, becoming one of the first to propose that players should train with a ball as opposed to merely undertaking physical exercise. In 1954 he was bought by Spurs for the huge fee of £30,000, and during his ten years at White Hart Lane he made 337 league appearances.



The highlight of his time at Spurs came with the 1960-61 season. With Blanchflower as captain Spurs won their first 11 games, still a record for the top flight of English football and eventually ran out as league champions by 8 points. They then beat Leicester City in the final of the FA Cup to become the first team in the 20th century to win the league and cup double not achieved since Aston Villa in 1897.



In 1962 he again captained Spurs to victory in the FA Cup, only narrowly missing out on a second double when they finished a close third in the league behind Ipswich Town and Burnley, and in 1963 he captained his side to victory over Atlético Madrid in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup.



Between 1949 and 1963, he earned 56 caps for Northern Ireland, often playing alongside his brother Jackie, and in 1958 captained his country when they reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup.



Career as manager.

After retiring as a player in April 1964, he withdrew from football for several years, returning briefly as manager of Northern Ireland in 1978, and as manager of Chelsea in 1978-1979, where he won just 5 out of 32 games as the club plunged towards relegation. He eventually left the job less than a year after his appointment, in September 1979.

Off the field.

He was one of only a handful of players to have been awarded the title of English Footballer of the Year on two occasions, winning in both 1958 and 1961. On February 6, 1961, he also became the first person to turn down the invitation to appear on This Is Your Life, simply walking away from host Eamonn Andrews live on air. ""I consider this programme to be an invasion of privacy"", he explained. ""Nobody is going to press gang me into anything.""



In the later years of his life, he suffered from Alzheimer's Disease, and died at his home in December 1993 aged 67. In 2003 Blanchflower was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his talents.

9390437,Minute Women of the U.S.A.,"The Minute Women of the U.S.A. was one of the largest of a number of militant anti-communist women's groups that was active during the 1950s and early 1960s. Such groups, which organized suburban housewives into anti-communist study groups, political activism and letter-writing campaigns, were a bedrock of support for McCarthyism. The primary concerns of the Minute Women and other similar groups were the exposure of communist subversion, the defence of constitutional limits, opposition to atheism, socialism and social welfare provisions such as the New Deal; and rejection of internationalism, particularly in the form of the United Nations.



The Minute Women were a national group founded by Suzanne Stevenson of Connecticut in September 1949. They grew rapidly, especially in Texas, California, West Virginia, Maryland, and Connecticut. By 1952 they had over 50,000 members. They were predominately white middle- and upper-class women aged between thirty and sixty, with school-aged or grown children. Chapters were relatively small, numbering only a few dozen or a few hundred people; the Houston chapter, which later became famous, numbered around 300. Over sixty of the Houstonian Minute Women were doctors' wives, reflecting medical opposition to socialized medicine. Although college-educated, they were poorly informed; many relied on the Facts Forum News published by Houston oil millionaire H. L. Hunt to disseminate his conspiracy theories.



Unlike many other anti-communist groups, the Minute Women operated in a semi-covert fashion. Stevenson instructed members to never reveal that they were Minute Women and always present themselves as individual concerned citizens. In her view, political activism was more effective when it appeared to be spontaneous.



The organization was structured in a unique fashion, ostensibly to defend against Communist infiltration. It had no constitution or bylaws, no parliamentary procedure to guide the meetings, and no option for motions from the floor; its officers were appointed rather than elected. Its members communicated via a chain-telephoning system in which one member called five others, who in turn made five more calls, enabling hundreds to be contacted within a short space of time. Membership of the Minute Women was restricted to American citizens, though ironically the group's founder had been born in Belgium and was the sister of the Belgian Ambassador, Baron Robert Silvercruys.



The Minute Women sought to apply political pressure through letter-writing campaigns, heckling speakers and swamping their opponents with telephone calls. In Houston, Texas, where they were particularly strong, they took over the local school board. They claimed to have planted observers in University of Houston classrooms to watch out for controversial material and teachers.



Their tactics were highly effective; as the Houston Post noted, ""Many public officials ... who might ... defy a lone organization ... would be loath to go against the wishes of 500 individuals."" The Houston Minute Women harassed and fired teachers and administrators, including the deputy superintendent of the Houston public schools, for alleged communism, and forced the university to eliminate history programs from its educational television broadcasts. An annual essay-writing contest sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was banned on the grounds that UNESCO was unacceptably ""internationalist"". At one point, the Minute Women circulated a report that ""troops flying the United Nations flag once took over several American cities in a surprise move, throwing the mayors in jail and locking up the police chiefs."" A member who pointed out the falsity of the report found herself ruled out of order by her fellow Minute Women.



Even well-respected groups and individuals found themselves targeted by the Minute Women. The Quakers' American Friends Service Committee was refused permission to use a Houston meeting hall after the Minute Women protested that Alger Hiss had once attended a Quaker meeting. Rufus Clement, the President of Atlanta University and the first-ever African-American to serve on the Atlanta Board of Education, faced protests from Minute Women when he lectured at a Houston Methodist church, on the grounds that he was ""too controversial"". The Houston Post commented that ""a new meaning has been given to the word controversial ... It now often becomes a derogatory epithet, frequently synonymous with the word Communist.""  There was an overt element of racism in the Minute Women's activities, which included distributing anti-semitic literature and opposing proponents of integrated schools, whom they regarded as Communist-inspired advocates of ""race mongrelization."" 



The Minute Women's campaign in Houston eventually backfired following an exposé by the Houston Post in 1953, which published an eleven-part series of articles written by Ralph O'Leary to highlight the group's activities. The newspaper was deluged by an avalanche of mail, much of which complimented it on the courage that it had displayed in taking on the Minute Women. O'Leary's reports were widely praised, with Time magazine describing the Post's coverage as ""a model of how a newspaper can effectively expose irresponsible vigilantism."" 



Despite this setback the Minute Women remained active throughout the remainder of the 1950s and into the 1960s. They played a major role in stoking the 1956 controversy over the Alaska Mental Health Bill (HR 6376), claiming that the bill was an attempt by Congress to give the government authority to abduct citizens at will and imprison them in concentration camps in Alaska.  The group finally faded away as the nation turned against McCarthyism and the anti-communist hysteria diminished.

1767914,Puteri Gunung Ledang (film),";



Puteri Gunung Ledang is a 2004 Malaysian film based on a Malay legend about a princess living on top of Gunung Ledang and a Malaccan sultan's effort to court her. Produced at a cost of USD $4 million, it was the first big-budget Malaysian movie. The movie, starring M. Nasir, Adlin Aman Ramlee, and lead actress, Tiara Jacquelina, was directed by Saw Teong Hin and produced by Shazalli Ramly. 



Plot.





Set in the late 15th century Sultanate of Malacca and the grand Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, against a backdrop of war and mysticism, the movie is about the forbidden romance that blossomed between Gusti Putri, a Javanese Hindu princess, and Hang Tuah, the famed Malay Muslim warrior from Melaka. The historic Melacca was once one of the world's great trading ports, and the most powerful maritime empire in Southeast Asia. History, mythology and fiction are fused to tell a fateful tale of forbidden love, in a time when allegiance and honor to country are foremost to personal desires.



Gusti Putri Retno Dumillah (Tiara Jacquelina), a princess of the Majapahit Kingdom, has fallen profoundly in love with one of Melaka s most commanding and spirited warriors, Hang Tuah (M. Nasir). A vivid dream compels the Princess to commit the unspeakable, and leave her assigned palace life. Without the consent of her king, she sets sail across the open seas, with the unflinching hope that she can be reunited with her one true love.



Soon after the princess  parting, the Majapahit Kingdom is attacked by the powerful Javanese Kingdom of Demak. Desperate to quell the invasion, Gusti Putri's brother and King, Gusti Adipati Handaya Ningrat (Alex Komang), initiates a plan to offer his sister's hand in marriage to the Prince of Demak. Her absence renders this solution impossible. The King's only hope for security is to forge an alliance with the mighty Melaka Sultanate by offering his sister's hand in marriage to Sultan Mahmud Shah of Melaka.



The Sultan accepts. But the Princess is unable to bring herself to do this as she could not bear to be his queen. The Princess instead offers to marry the Prince of Demak. The indignant Sultan will not accept the rejection, nor will he be publicly humiliated. He plots to marry the princess at all cost.



Hang Tuah is ordered to head the royal delegation, and proposes to Gusti Putri on behalf of the Sultan. The warrior devotedly leads the convoy up Gunung Ledang in search of the woman he deeply loves. The Princess attempts to curtail their advance, but eventually yields to Hang Tuah's appeal.



Gusti Adipati was extremely angry that Hang Tuah is getting in his way and invoked supernatural powers to combat him. He instantly appeared by Hang Tuah with wearing ornately designed armor and challenged him to a combat. Despite his supernatural prowess, he is defeated by Hang Tuah and his magical Taming Sari kris. The injured Gusti Adipati expresses that the fate of his country is more important than some love, and Hang Tuah's meddling has destroyed his only hope of saving his people. The guilty Hang Tuah, along with the fact that he can't go against the wishes of his Sultan, resigned as Laksamana and cast his Taming Sari kris into the river, never to be found again.



After a fleeting and tender reunion, the Princess is painfully aware that her beloved's foremost duty is that of a warrior. Despite confessing his love for her, Hang Tuah will not forsake the Sultan's wishes. Brokenhearted, she agrees to marry the Sultan on the proviso that he is able to fulfill seven prohibitive conditions:

 A bridge made of pure gold from Melaka to Gunung Ledang;

 Another bridge made of pure silver from Melaka to Gunung Ledang;

 Seven trays (dulang) of the hearts of mosquitoes;

 Seven jars (tempayan) of the juice of young betel nuts (Note: Young betel nuts do not have juice);

 One jar (tempayan) of tears;

 One bowl of blood from the Sultan himself; and;

 One bowl of blood from his fondest son, Sultan Ahmad.



When the Sultan learns of the Princess' prohibitive conditions, he is even more determined to marry her. But before he could draw blood from his son, the mental projection of Gusti Putri appeared before his eyes. She explained to him that her conditions are nothing more than an indirect refusal of his proposal for marriage. The Sultan, feeling ridiculed planted a curse that starting from next sunlight whomsoever saw the princess will die coughing blood (in Malay folklore sultans carry the power of ""tulah"", which means that his curse comes true).



Hang Tuah, having heard of the curse of the Sultan from the Bendahara, rushed to Mount Ledang to see her one last time. With only one day remaining he rushes to the top, only to arrive after the sun has risen.



But Hang Tuah is so determined to see her again that he wouldn't care that it would cost him his life. The story ends when Gusti Putri reveals herself to him. It is henceforth unknown what happens to him and her next. And the story of the two continues for generations up until know in a legend known as Puteri Gunung Ledang (Princess of Mount Ledang).



Awards.

Tiara Jacquelina won the ""Best Actress"" category at the 50th Asia Pacific Film Festival, as well as the ""Best Producer"" award at the inaugural Asian Festival of First Films in Singapore (2005).

6626676,Carrickfergus (song),"""Carrickfergus"" is an Irish folk song. It is a typical lament of an Irish expatriate who wishes he was back in his homeland.



The origins of the song are unclear, but it has been traced to an Irish language song, The Sick Young Lover .



The song has been recorded by many well-known performers including Declan Affley, Dominic Behan, Joan Baez, De Dannan, Charlotte Church, Loreena McKennitt and Peter O'Toole.





Lyrics.



I wish I was in Carrickfergus,

Only for nights in Ballygrant;

I would swim over the deepest ocean,

For my love to find;



But the sea is wide and I cannot cross over;

And neither have I the wings to fly;

I wish I could meet a handsome boatsman;

To ferry me over, to my love and die;



My childhood days bring back sad reflections;

Of happy times I spent so long ago,

My boyhood friends and my own relations;

Have all passed on now like melting snow.



But I'll spend my days in endless roaming,

Soft is the grass, my bed is free.

Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus,

On that long road down to the sea.



Now in Kilkenny, it is reported,

On marble stones there as black as ink;

With gold and silver I would support her,

But I'll sing no more 'till I get a drink.



For I'm drunk today, and I'm seldom sober,

A handsome rover from town to town,

Ah, but I'm sick now, my days are numbered,

Come all you young men and lay me down."

880336,Bobby's World,"Bobby's World is a children's animated television series, which ran from 1990 to 1998, on FOX. It was about the daily life of Bobby Generic (pronounced JEN-er-ick, unlike the adjective that is pronounced ji-NER-ick) and his very overactive imagination on how he sees the world.  This show was created by Howie Mandel (now the host of NBC's Deal or No Deal), who was also the voice of four-year-old Bobby (as well as Bobby's father, who looks just like a cartoon version of Howie himself), and was produced by Film Roman for Fox Television Studios and Fox Kids Network.  In a recent online interview, Mandel expressed his desire for a possible re-launch of the series. On September 28, 2006, Mandel mentioned on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that the series will be returning in 2007, in addition to doing his job hosting Deal or No Deal. He further mentioned that the series was returning on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. While he did not mention it during his November 15, 2006 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brian he wore a shirt that read ""Generic Rules"", a possible reference to Bobby's last name.



History.



The character of ""Bobby"" can likely be traced back to Mandel's days as a stand up comedian in Canada and later the United States. Mandel would commonly go into character with the same voice as Bobby, often conversing with an unseen ""parent"". .



Show Format.



Episodes often consist of a short live action segment either before or after the main story (and sometimes both before and after). The segment would include Mandel describing some aspect of the story and often relating it back to his personal childhood.

Sometimes during these segments, the character of Bobby would appear in animated form and converse with Mandel. Other times, a live action child would appear and exchange words with Mandel. Endings of the show also featured a form of Mandel breaking the proverbial Fourth wall by talking to the audience about the episode

3136942,Caroline Kirkland,"Caroline Kirkland (January 12, 1801   April 6, 1864) was an American writer. 



She was born into a middle class family in New York City, the oldest of eleven children. Her mother was a writer of fiction and poetry. Her father died when she was 21 and the family followed her to upstate New York where she taught and had met her future husband, William Kirkland. The death of her father had made her mainly responsible for the rest of the family. She married William in 1828 and they settled in Geneva, New York  where they founded the Domestic school. They had five children (one of whom died) before they left Geneva.



In 1835 the Kirklands moved to the then frontier town of Detroit, Michigan and in 1837 they founded the village of Pinckney on land that William had purchased. It was there that Caroline had success with her first book,  A New Home; Who'll Follow. She wrote another book about life in the settlements, Forest Life, while still in Michigan. The Kirklands left Michigan in 1843 because their venture to establish the town of Pinckney was not a financial success, and because they felt shut out by the reactions of their neighbors to Mrs. Kirkland's frank revelations of frontier life. A third book based on frontier life, Western Clearings,  came out in 1845, after she had returned with her family to New York City.



In New York William Kirkland entered the newspaper business as editor of the New York Evening Mirror, and of his own paper, the Christian Inquirer. In 1846 an unfortunate accident resulted in his death. Mrs. Kirkland continued her literary activities until her death in 1864. Their son Joseph Kirkland, who was born in Geneva, also became a recognized writer.



On returning to New York, Mrs. Kirkland opened a school for girls and from 1847 to 1849 was editor of the Union Magazine. She also entered into the literary social life of the community often entertaining writers, publishers, and other notables. Her home was the leading literary salon in the country where Edgar Allan Poe, William Cullen Bryant, Elizabeth Drew Stoddard, and others frequently assembled. Mrs. Kirkland went abroad in 1848 and again in 1850. She was received by Charles Dickens and the Brownings, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning.  She also became a close friend and correspondent of Harriet Martineau.



Kirkland, as attested to by the above names, had considerable fame and accolades from her writings during her lifetime. Poe in particular thought of her as a significant American writer. She was a relatively early American woman writer who appears to have written because she liked to write and only published what she considered to be well written. She wrote for men as well as women but definitely wrote from a female perspective. Her works continue to be studied in relation to style, contributions to American literature and the influence of the female perspective.

1292792,Rafael Godoy,"Rafael Godoy was a well-known Colombian composer born in Natagaima, Tolima, in 1907.



From a young age, he was linked to the trade-union movement in Barrancabermeja, Santander, from where he had to emigrate when his personal security was threatened. He fled to Venezuela, where he developed his musical career and composed what are often taken to be his best musical pieces.



It is possibly because of his distancing from the Colombian artistic environment of the time that Godoy's work is not so wide, and details about his personal life are not widely known.



His most widely known, and possibly best song, is the bambuco ""Soy colombiano"" (I'm Colombian); he composed many other less-known bambucos and andean music songs, such as ""Arrunchaditos"", ""Pasito"", ""Mi cafetal"", ""Canto a Colombia"", ""Tierra caliente"" and many others.



Many versions of ""Soy colombiano"" have appeared since it was composed, even a vallenato version by Lisandro Meza, although the most popular version is the one from the Tolimense folk music duet Garzón y Collazos.



Rafael Godoy died in Caracas, Venezuela, on March 14, 1973.

1682298,Asymptotically flat spacetime,"An asymptotically flat spacetime is a Lorentzian manifold in which, roughly speaking, the curvature vanishes at large distances from some region, so that at large distances, the geometry becomes indistinguishable from that of Minkowski spacetime.



While this notion makes sense for any Lorentzian manifold, it is most often applied to a spacetime standing as a solution to the field equations of some metric theory of gravitation, particularly general relativity.  In this case, we can say that an asymptotically flat spacetime is one in which the gravitational field, as well as any matter or other fields which may be present, become negligible in magnitude at large distances from some region.  In particular, in an asymptotically flat vacuum solution, the gravitational field (curvature) becomes negligible at large distances from the source of the field (typically some isolated massive object such as a star).



Intuitive significance.

The condition of asymptotic flatness is analogous to similar conditions in mathematics and in other physical theories.  Such conditions say that some physical field or mathematical function is asymptotically vanishing in a suitable sense.



In general relativity, an asymptotically flat vacuum solution models the exterior gravitational field of an isolated massive object.  Therefore, such a spacetime can be considered as examples of isolated systems in the sense in which this term is used in physics in general.  (Isolated systems are ones which in which exterior influences can be neglected.)  Indeed, physicists rarely imagine a universe containing a single star and nothing else when they construct an asymptotically flat model of a star; rather, they are interested in modeling the interior of the star together with an exterior region in which gravitational effects due to the presence of other objects, such as ""nearby"" stars, can be neglected.  Since typical distances between astrophysical bodies tend to be much larger than the diameter of each body, we often can get way with this idealization, which usually helps to greatly simplify the construction and analysis of solutions.



Some examples and nonexamples.

Only spacetimes which model an isolated object are asymptotically flat.  Many other familiar exact solutions, such as the FRW dust models (which are homogeneous spacetimes and therefore in a sense at the opposite end of the spectrum from asymptotically flat spacetimes), are not.



A simple example of an asymptotically flat spacetime is the Schwarzschild vacuum solution.  More generally, the Kerr vacuum is also asymptotically flat.  But another well known generalization of the Schwarzschild vacuum, the NUT vacuum, is not asymptotically flat.  An even simpler generalization, the Schwarzschild-de Sitter lambdavacuum solution (sometimes called the Köttler solution), which models a spherically symmetric massive object immersed in a de Sitter universe, is an example of an asymptotically simple spacetime which is not asymptotically flat.  



On the other hand, there are important large families of solutions which are asymptotically flat, such as the AF Weyl vacuums and their rotating generalizations, the AF Ernst vacuums (the family of all stationary axisymmetric and asymptoticallly flat vacuum solutions).  These families are given by the solution space of a much simplified family of partial differential equations, and their metric tensors can be written down (say in a prolate spheroidal chart)

in terms of an explicit multipole expansion.



A coordinate-dependent definition.

The simplest (and historically the first) way of defining an asymptotically flat spacetime assumes that we have a coordinate chart, with coordinates , which far from the origin behaves much like a Cartesian chart on Minkowski spacetime, in the following sense.  Write the metric tensor as the sum of a (physically unobservable) Minkowski background plus a perturbation tensor, , and set .  Then we require:

;

;

;

One reason why we require the partial derivatives of the perturbation to decay so quickly is that these conditions turn out to imply that the gravitational field energy density (to the extent that this somewhat nebulous notion makes sense in a metric theory of gravitation) decays like , which would be physically sensible.  (In classical electromagnetism, the energy of the electromagnetic field of a point charge decays like .)



A coordinate-free definition.

Around 1962, Hermann Bondi, Rainer Sachs, and others began to study the general phenomenon of radiation from a compact source in general relativity, which requires more flexible definitions of asymptotic flatness.  In 1963, Roger Penrose imported from algebraic geometry the essential innovation, now called conformal compactification, and in 1972, Robert Geroch used this to circumvent the tricky problem of suitably defining and evaluating suitable limits in formulating a truly coordinate-free definition of asymptotic flatness.  In the new approach, once everything is properly set up, one need only evaluate functions on a locus in order to verify asymptotic flatness.



Utility.

The notion of asymptotic flatness is extremely useful as a technical condition in the study of exact solutions in general relativity and allied theories.  There are several reasons for this:

Models of physical phenomena in general relativity (and allied physical theories) generally arise as the solution of appropriate systems of differential equations, and assuming asymptotic flatness provides boundary conditions which assist in setting up and even in solving the resulting boundary value problem.

In metric theories of gravitation such as general relativity, it is usually not possible to give general definitions of important physical concepts such as mass and angular momentum; however, assuming asympotical flatness allows one to employ convenient definitions which do make sense for asymptotically flat solutions.

While this is less obvious, it turns out that invoking asympotic flatness allows physicists to import sophisticated mathematical concepts from algebraic geometry and differential topology in order to define and study important features such as event horizons which may or may not be present.



Objections.

The notion of asympotic flatness in gravitation physics has been criticized on both theoretical and technical grounds.



There is no difficulty whatever in obtaining models of static spherically symmetric stellar models, in which a perfect fluid interior is matched across a spherical surface, the surface of the star, to a vacuum exterior which is in fact a region of the Schwarzschild vacuum.  In fact, it is possible to write down all these static stellar models in a way which makes clear that they exist in plenitude.  Given this success, it may come as a nasty shock that it seems to be very difficult, mathematically speaking, to construct rotating stellar models in which a perfect fluid interior is matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior.  This observation is the basis of the most prominent technical objection to the notion of asymptotic flatness in general relativity.



Before explaining this objection in more detail, it seems appropriate to briefly discuss an often overlooked point about physical theories in general.



Asymptotic flatness is an idealization, and a very useful one, both in our current ""Gold Standard"" theory of gravitation -- General Relativity -- and in the simpler theory it ""overthrew"", Newtonian gravitation.  One might expect that as a (so far mostly hypothetical) sequence of increasingly sophisticated theories of gravitation provide more and more accurate models of fundamental physics, these theories will become monotonically more ""powerful"".  But this hope is probably naive: we should expect a monotonically increasing range of choices in making various theoretical tradeoffs, rather than monotonic ""improvement"".  In particular, as our physical theories become more and more accurate, we should expect that it will become harder and harder to employ idealizations with the same ease with which we can invoke them in more forgiving (that is, less restrictive) theories.  This is because more accurate theories necessarily demand setting up more accurate boundary conditions, which can render it difficult to see how to set up some idealization familiar in a simpler theory in a more sophisticated theory.  Indeed, we must expect that some idealizations admitted by previous theories may not be admitted at all by succeeding theories.  



This phenomenon can be both a blessing and a curse.  For example, we have just noted that some physicists hold that more sophisticated theories of gravitation will not admit any notion of an isolated point particle.   Indeed, some argue that general relativity does not do so, despite the existence of the Schwarzschild vacuum solution.  If these physicists are correct, we would gain a kind of self-abnegating intellectual honesty or realism, but we would pay a hefty price, since few idealizations have proven as fruitful in physics as the notion of a point particle (however troublesome it has been even in simpler theories).



Be this as it may, very few examples of exact solutions modeling isolated and rotating objects in general relativity are presently known.   In fact, the list of useful solutions presently consists of the Neugebauer-Meinel dust (which models a rigidly rotating thin (finite radius) disk of dust surrounded by an asymptotically flat vacuum region) and a few variants.  In particular, there is no known perfect fluid source which can be matched to a Kerr vacuum exterior, as one would expect in order to create the simplest possible model of a rotating star.  This is surprising because of the plenitude of fluid interiors which match to Schwarzschild vacuum exteriors.



Indeed, if some argue that an interior solution which matches to the Kerr vacuum, which has Petrov type D, should also be type D.  There is in fact a known perfect fluid solution, the Wahlquist fluid, which is Petrov type D and which has a definite surface across which one can attempt to match to a vacuum exterior.  However, it turns out that the Wahlquist fluid cannot be matched to any asymptotically flat vacuum region.  In particular, contrary to naive expectation, it cannot be matched to a Kerr vacuum exterior.  A tiny minority of physicists (actually, a minority of one) appear to believe that general relativity is unacceptable because it does not allow sufficiently general asymptotically flat solutions (evidently this argument implicitly assumes that we have decisively rejected at least some Machian principles!), but a sequence of increasingly sophisticated and general existence results appears to contradict this assumption.



The mainstream viewpoint among physicists about these matters can probably be summarized by saying as follows:

while many prominent researchers have tried to invoke Machian principles (including Albert Einstein and John Archibald Wheeler), the status of these principles, in contrast to widely accepted principles like the principle of conservation of momentum, is currently highly equivocal,

general relativity admits a sufficient variety of solutions to model (in principle) any realistic astrophysical situation, plus (apparently) many highly unrealistic ones.

On the rotating fluid problem raised by Mark Roberts, see:



 eprint  The authors argue that boundary value problems in general relativity, such as the problem matching a given perfect fluid interior to an asymptoically flat vacuum exterior, are overdetermined.  This doesn't imply that no models of a rotating star exist, but it helps to explain why they seem to be hard to construct.

177454,Russian Airborne Troops,"The  Russian Airborne Troops or VDV ( from ""Vozdushno-Desantnye Voyska"" Russian:         -                 =    ) is an arm of service of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on a par with the Strategic Rocket Forces and the Space Troops. The Airborne Troops are the most capable mobile assault forces of Russia, as they are airborne forces in the first place.



Soviet Era.

Originally formed in the Soviet Union during the mid 1930s, they were massively expanded during World War II, where they formed up to ten Airborne Corps with numerous Independent Airborne Brigades, with most or all achieving ""Guards"" status. One of the new units was the 100th Airborne Division. At the end of the war they were reconstituted as Guards Rifle Divisions. They were later rebuilt and eventually formed seven Air Assault Divisions. With an Independent Air Assault regiment and up to sixteen Air Assault Brigades. They were formed into their own VDV command to give the Soviets a Rapid Strike force to spearhead strategic military operations. 





In 1989, the Airborne Forces consisted of:

7th Airborne Division (Kaunas, Lithuanian SSR);

76th Airborne Division (Pskov, RSFSR);

98th Airborne Division (Bolgrad & Kishinev, Moldovan SSR);

103rd Airborne Division (Vitebsk);

104th Guards Airborne Division (Kirovabad, Azerbaijan SSR);

106th Guards Airborne Division (Tula, RSFSR);

242nd Training Centre of the Airborne Forces (Jonava, Lithuanian SSR);

345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment (Gudauta, Georgian SSR);

11th Air Assault Brigade;

13th Air Assault Brigade;

14th, 21st, 23rd, 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th, 39th, 40th, 56th, 83rd, 95th, 100th Air Assault Brigades;

171st Independent Communications Brigade (Medvezhi Ozera, Moscow Military District, RSFSR);



After the Fall of the Soviet Union.



With the demise of the Soviet Union, the number of VDV divisions has shrunk from seven to four, as well as one brigade:

7th Airborne Division, Novorossiysk;

76th Air Assault Division, Pskov;

98th Airborne Division, Ivanovo;

106th Airborne Division, Tula;

31st Airborne Brigade, Ulyanovsk;



Two other Air Assault Brigades are partially infantry formations reporting directly to the military districts they are stationed in. The VDV's training institute is the Ryazan Institute for the Airborne Troops named for V. Margelov. In the early 1990s, General Pavel Grachev, first Russian Defence Minister planned for the VDV to form the core of the planned Mobile Forces. This was announced in Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda) in July 1992. However, the Mobile Forces plan never eventuated. The number of formations available for the force was far less than anticipated, since much of the Airborne Forces had been 'nationalised' by the republics their units had been previously based in, and other arms of service, such as the GRU and Military Transport Aviation, who were to provide the airlift component, were adamantly opposed to ceding control of their forces.



Furthermore, 104th Parachute Landing Regiment of 76th Airborne Division is the only Russian land forces regiment, that is fully composed of professional soldiers (and not of ""srochniki"" - the conscripted soldiers aged eighteen). It should be noted however that an additional major contractorisation of many many units across the Russian armed forces is now under way. It was announced that the 98th Airborne Division is also earmarked for contractorisation.



Unlike western airborne units which must walk when they arrive at their destination, the VDV divisions are mechanized with over 250 armored fighting vehicles, the BMD-3 family of vehicles. VDV units have superior mobility with these vehicles and superior firepower, each division has three regiments equipped with them and their derivatives. The single independent brigade, the 31st at Ulyanovsk, however, is not equipped with its own armor or artillery and may be equivalent to western airborne, in that it functions as light infantry and must walk when reaching their destination. The 31st was the former 104th Guards Airborne Division.







VDV troops participated in the rapid deployment of Russian forces in and around Pristina airport during the Kosovo War, surprising NATO. They also were deployed in Chechnya as an active bridgehead for other forces to follow.



A VDV unit, the 45th ORPSN (Separate Reconnaissance Regiment of Special Designation), that reportedly performed brilliantly in Chechnya during the second campaign, was said to actually represent a Spetznaz GRU unit, which was later proven untrue.  



In 2004, the Russian MoD announced that the VDV will be re-equipped with new APC vehicles of the BMD-4 type (RIA Novosti, December 20th, 2004). However, it is unlikely that this reorganization will happen in the years to come due to lack of funding and resistance from within the VDV. 



Russian airborne troops had their own holiday during the Soviet era, which continues to be celebrated on the 2nd of August. 



Notable former Airborne Forces officers include Aleksandr Lebed, who was involved in responses to disorder in the Caucasus republics in the last years of the Soviet Union, and Pavel Grachev who went on to become the first Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation.

65755,Yeti,"The Abominable Snowman is a humanoid cryptid associated with the Himalaya.  The names Yeti or Meh-Teh are commonly used by people indigenous to the Himalaya, and are part of their history and mythology. 



Most mainstream scientists, explorers and writers with experience of the area, consider current evidence of the Yeti's existence to be weak and better explained as hoax, legend, or misidentification of known species. Nevertheless, the Yeti remains one of the most famous creatures of cryptozoology.



 Nomenclature .

The name Yeti is derived from the Tibetan yeh-teh (), a compound of the words yeh () meaning ""rocky"" or ""rocky place"" and ti, te or teh () which  translates as ""bear"", the full name being ""rock bear"".



Pranavananda goes on further to illustrate the root of the words ""ti"", ""te"" and ""teh"" in that they are derived from the spoken word  'tre'  (spelled ""dred""),  Tibetan for bear, with the 'r' softly pronounced as to be almost inaudible, thus making it ""te"" or ""teh"".



Other terms, used by the indigenous peoples of the Himalaya, do not all translate exactly the same, but refer to both legend and indigenous wildlife.



 Meh-teh () translates as ""man-bear"";

 Dzu-teh - 'dzu' translates as ""cattle"" and the full meaning translates as ""cattle bear"" and is the Himalayan Red Bear.;

 Migoi or Mi-go () (pronounced mey-goo) translates as ""Wild Man"" (.;

 Mirka - another name for ""wild-man"", however as local legend has it ""anyone who sees one dies or is killed"". The latter is taken from a written statement by Frank Smythe's sherpas in 1937.;

 Kang Admi - ""Snow Man"";

 Jo-bran - ""Man-beast"";



Animals that live in the Himalaya, known to Tibetans, Nepalese and mammologists,  that are directly linked with the Yeti phenomena are the Chu-Teh, a Langur monkey  living at lower altitudes, the Tibetan Blue Bear, the Himalayan Brown Bear and the Dzu-Teh which is the Himalayan Red Bear.



The term Yeti is often used to describe a number of very different reported creatures:



 A large ape-like biped (that some suggest could be a Gigantopithecus);

 Human-sized bipedal apes (the Almas and the Chinese wildman);

 Dwarf-like creatures (such as the Orang Pendek).



The term is also often used to refer to reported creatures that fits any of these descriptions: for example, the fear liath may be referred to as the ""Scottish Yeti"".



Neil Gaiman propsed that the word Yeti literally translated as ""That thing over there."" As in ""Honored Sherpa, what is that thing over there?"" ""Yeti.""



 The Origin of the ""Abominable Snowman"" .

The appellation ""Abominable Snowman"" did not come into existence until 1921, in that year Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury lead the Royal Geographical Society's ""Everest Reconnaissance Expedition"" from which he authored ""Mount Everest The Reconnaissance, 1921"" in his book he wrote, amongst the details of the expedition, of an account, whilst crossing the ""Lhakpa-la"" at 21,000 feet  where, he later wrote, he found footprints in the snow.  Howard-Bury stated that these tracks ""were probably caused by a large 'loping' grey wolf, which in the soft snow formed double tracks rather like a those of a barefooted man"".  However Howard-Bury also stated that ""our coolies at once volunteered that the tracks must be that of ""The Wild Man of the Snows"", to which they gave the name ""metoh-kangmi"""".  ""Metoh"" translates as ""man bear""  and ""Kang-mi"" translates as ""snowman"".



Confusion exists between Howard-Bury's use of ""metoh-kangmi"", the words his Boatia Sherpa's had used and recited in his book and the account provided in H.W. Tilman's book ""Mount Everest, 1938"" where Tilman had used the words ""metch"" (it has been suggested that ""metch"" does not exist in Tibetan and ""kangmi"" when relating the details of and the eventual creation of the term ""Abominable Snowman"". Further weight is added to the notion that ""metch"" is a misnomer, is provided by Prof. David Snellgrove from London School of Oriental Studies and a recognised authority on the Tibetan language (1956), dismissed the word ""metch"" stating that it was impossible to conjoin the consonants  ""t c h"" in Tibetan."". Documentation does seem to suggest that there are very few examples of the term ""metch-kangmi"",  the term seems to stem from just the one source in 1921.  It has been suggested that ""metch"" is a misspelling of ""metoh"".



The involvement of Mr. Henry Newman, who contributed for many years to ""The Statesman"" in Calcutta using the pen-name ""Kim"", spoke with the porters of the ""Everest Reconnaissance expedition"" on return to Darjeeling, and for whatever reason Newman either by artistic license or a mistranslation of ""Metoh"" as ""filthy"" or ""dirty"", which as has been demonstrated it does not mean, created the term ""Abominable"". Some credence to the suggestion that Newman's artistic predilection played a role is the statement made by H.W. Tilman in his book, that ""As he (Newman) wrote long after in a letter to The Times: The whole story seemed such a joyous creation I sent it to one or two newspapers'"".



""Whatever effect Mr. Newman intended, from 1921 onwards the Yeti-or whatever various native populations choose to call it- became saddled with the description ""Abominable Snowman,"" an appellation which can only appeal to the music-hall mind than to mammalogists, a fact which has seriously handicapped earnest seekers of the truth"", a view supported by and Sanderson



""It cannot be denied however that Mr. Newman put the Yeti ""on the map"".  During the twenties and thirties sightings of both of prints and of the animal itself occurred right across the Himalaya from the Burmese frontier to the Karakoram, not all of them by credulous witnesses."".



 The 1954 Pangboche Scalp Investigation .









The  Daily Mail ""Snowman Expedition"" of 1954, on March 19 printed an article, where the expedition teams obtained and submitted specimens of hairs from the scalp in Pangboche monastery. The research on the hair was conducted by Professor Frederic Wood Jones, F.R.S, D.Sc., (who died on September 29 1954) and an expert in human and comparative anatomy.



The research consisted of taking micro-photographs of the hairs and comparing them with hairs from known animals such as the bear and orangutan.



He (Professor Woods-Jones) was of the opinion that the evidence of the hairs and the photographs, from the Pangboche monastery ""scalp"", proved it was not a scalp of any type.  The reason for this is that although some animals have a ridge of hair beginning at the top of the head and extending between the shoulders to the back, he did not believe that any animals have a ridge such as shown in the photographs of the Pangboche relic running from the base of the forehead across the top of the head and ending at the back of the neck""



The hairs were black or dark brown in colour in dull light, and a ""foxy-red"" in sunlight. None of these had been dyed and they were probably exceedingly old.



The hairs were bleached, cut into sections and compared microscopically with those of known animals. Wood-Jones was unable to suggest from what animal the Pangboche hairs were taken.  He was, however convinced they are not the hairs of an anthropoid ape, nor of a bear.  He suggests they may come from the hair of a coarse-haired hoofed animal, but not from its head; they may be from its shoulder.



 Events .

 19th century .

In 1832, the Journal of the Asiatic society of Bengal published the account of B. H. Hodgson, who wrote that while trekking in northern Nepal, his native guides spotted a tall, bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, then fled in fear. Hodgson did not see the creature, but concluded it was an orangutan.



An early record of reported footprints appeared in 1889 in L.A. Waddell's Among the Himalayas He reported his native guides described a large apelike creature that left the prints, but concluded the prints were made by a bear. Waddell heard stories of bipedal, apelike creatures, but wrote that of the many witnesses he questioned, none ""could ever give me an authentic case. On the most superficial investigation it always resolved into something that somebody had heard of."" 



 Early 20th century .

The frequency of reports increased in the early 20th century, when Westerners began making determined attempts to climb the many mountains in the area and sometimes reported seeing odd creatures or strange tracks.



In 1925, N.A. Tombazi, a photographer  and member of the Royal Geographical Society, saw a creature at about 15,000 ft  near Zemu Glacier. Tombazi later wrote that he observed the creature from about 200 or 300 yards, for about one minute. ""Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf rhododendron bushes. It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes.""  About two hours later, Tombazi and his companions descended the mountain, and saw what they took to be the creature's prints, described as ""similar in shape to those of a man, but only six to seven inches long by four inches wide....  The prints were undoubtedly those of a biped.""



 Late 20th century .

Western interest in the Yeti peaked dramatically in the 1950s. While attempting to scale Mount Everest in 1951, Eric Shipton took photographs of a number of large prints in the snow, at about 6,000 m (19,685 ft) above sea level. These photos have been subject to intense study and debate. Some argue they are the best evidence of Yeti's reality, but others contend the prints are from a mundane creature and have been distorted and enlarged by the melting snow.



In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reported seeing large footprints while scaling Mount Everest. Hillary would later discount Yeti reports as unreliable.



During the Daily Mail Snowman Expedition of 1954, the largest search of its kind, the mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson, made the first trek from Everest to Kangchenjunga and in the process photographed symbolic paintings of the Yeti at Thyangboche Gompa. Jackson tracked and also photographed many footprints in the snow, many of which were identifiable. However, there were many large footprints which could not be identified. The flattened footprint-like indentations were attributed to erosion and subsequent widening of the original footprint by wind and particle action.



Beginning in 1957, Tom Slick, an American who had made a fortune in oil, funded a few missions to investigate Yeti reports. In 1959, feces reportedly from a Yeti were collected by Slick's expedition. Analysis found a parasite but could not classify it. Bernard Heuvelmans wrote that ""Since each animal has its own parasites, this indicated that the host animal is equally an unknown animal."" 



In 1959, actor Jimmy Stewart, while visiting India, reportedly smuggled the remains of a supposed Yeti, the so-called Pangboche Hand, by hiding them in his luggage when he flew from India to London.



In 1960, Sir Edmund Hillary mounted an expedition to collect and evaluate evidence for the Yeti and sent a Yeti scalp from the Khumjung monastery to the West for testing. The results indicated that the scalp had been manufactured from the skin of the serow, a goat-like Himalayan antelope. But some disagreed with this analysis. Shackley said they ""pointed out that hairs from the scalp look distinctly monkey-like, and that it contains parasitic mites of a species different from that recovered from the serow.""



In 1970, British mountaineer Don Whillans says he saw a creature while scaling Annapurna. While scouting for a campsite, Whillans heard some odd cries. His Sherpa guide told him the sound was a Yeti's call. That night, reported Whillans, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. The next day, Whillans observed a few human like footprints in the snow, and that evening, he asserted that with binoculars, he watched a bipedal, ape-like creature for about 20 minutes as it apparently searched for food not far from his camp. 



 Analysis .

The anthropologist John Napier (primatologist) in his book ""Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality"", a detailed collation of writings, first hand reports and analysis on the subject, argued that amongst what evidence there is for the Yeti, ""unlike the Sasquatch, there is little uniformity of pattern, and what uniformity there is incriminates the bear"".



In 2003, Japanese mountaineer Makoto Nebuka published the results of his 12-year linguistic study and postulated that the word ""Yeti"" is actually a corruption of the word ""meti"" - a regional dialect term for ""bear"". The ethnic Tibetans fear and worship the bear (as in many traditional cultures) as a supernatural being. Nebuka's claims were subject to almost immediate criticism, however, and Nebuka was accused of linguistic carelessness. Dr Raj Kumar Pandey, for example, who has also researched both Yetis and mountain languages, said ""it is not enough to blame tales of the mysterious beast of the Himalayas on words that rhyme but mean different things.""



Many cryptozoologists,  after examining eye-witness reports and statistical evidence, have concluded that Yeti reports are misidentification of mundane creatures. Well-financed expeditions have turned up little positive evidence of its existence, although one expedition to Bhutan did retrieve a hair sample that, after DNA analysis, could not be matched to any known animal.



In 1997, Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner claimed to have come face to face with a Yeti. He has since written a book, My Quest for the Yeti, and also claims to have actually killed one. According to Messner, the Yeti is actually the endangered Himalayan Brown Bear, Ursus arctos isabellinus, that can walk upright or on all fours.



Enthusiasts speculate that these reported creatures could be present-day specimens of the extinct giant ape Gigantopithecus, as the only evidence (other than teeth) recovered from Gigantopithecus (its jawbone) indicates a skull rested upon a vertical spinal column (as in hominines and other bipedal apes such as Oreopithecus). However, while the Yeti is usually described as bipedal, most scientists feel that Gigantopithicus was probably  quadrupedal, and so massive that unless it evolved specifically as a bipedal ape (like Oreopithecus and the hominids) upright walking would have been even more difficult for the now extinct primate than it is for its extant quadrupedal relative, the orangutan.



 The Yeti in popular culture .





The Yeti has become a cultural icon, appearing in movies, books and video games. Mainly this is in the abominable snowman style, but occasionally as comic relief. In 2006, Disney opened a ride called ""Expedition Everest"" in Animal Kingdom in Walt Disney World. Inside the waiting area lays a Yeti museum, complete with Yeti-wrecked items and cement encased footprints.

9142949,Mendy Samstein,"Jehudah Menachem Mendel ""Mendy"" Samstein (July 25 1938 - January 24 2007) was an American civil rights activist. 



Born in Manhattan, he majored in European history at Brandeis, and later earned a master's degree in the same subject from Cornell. He was studying for a Ph.D. in history at the University of Chicago when he quit to join the civil rights movement in the South. He became a full-time organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (or SNCC, pronounced ""snick""). Stokely Carmichael, later chairman of SNCC, called Samstein ""one in a million"".



Later on, Samstein also organized protests against the Vietnam War. He had a variety of jobs, including working as a teacher, as a psychoanalyst, and running a summer camp. In 2000, he and other civil rights veterans protested the handling of the presidential vote in Florida. 



Samstein was married to Nancy Cooper, a fellow civil rights activist. He died from carcinoid cancer at his home in New Lisbon, New York, aged 68.

359380,LZMA,"LZMA, short for Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm, is a data compression algorithm in development since 1998 and used in the 7z format of the 7-Zip archiver. It uses a dictionary compression scheme somewhat similar to LZ77 and features a high compression ratio (generally higher than bzip2) and a variable compression-dictionary size (up to 1 GB).



 Overview .

The LZMA uses an improved LZ77 compression algorithm, backed by a range coder.



Streams for data, repeated-sequence size and repeated-sequence location seem to be compressed separately.



 7-Zip reference implementation .

The reference implementation of LZMA is included as part of the 7z and 7-Zip suite of tools. Source code is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPL license.



The reference open source LZMA compression library is written in C++ and has the following properties:



 Compression speed: approximately 1 MB per second on a 2 GHz CPU;

 Decompression speed: between 10 and 20 MB per second on a 2 GHz CPU;

 Support for multi-threading and for the Pentium 4 microprocessor's hyper-threading feature.



The 7-Zip implementation uses several variants of hash chains, binary trees and Patricia tries as the basis for its dictionary search algorithm.



Decompression-only code for LZMA generally compiles to around 5kB and the amount of RAM required during decompression is principally determined by the size of the sliding window used during compression. Small code size and relatively low memory overhead, particularly with smaller dictionary lengths, make the LZMA decompression algorithm well-suited to embedded applications.



 Portability of the reference implementation .

Wide use of Microsoft Windows-specific features are deeply buried in the source code, meaning that despite the reference implementation being Free software it has taken a while for a Unix-compatible version to appear.



Currently, there are two working ports to Unix-like platforms:



 p7zip, a port of 7-Zip's 7z and 7za command-line tools. p7zip produces standard 7z archive stream where LZMA can be combined with additional filters, such as relative address pre-processing for jump and call instructions in an executable file.

 LZMA Utils, a port consisting of only the LZMA code and designed to work with raw LZMA streams in a similar way to the compression utilities gzip and bzip2. For archiving of multiple files, the lzma tool would be used on top of an archive format such as .tar. The produced output is raw LZMA with no header information.



Note that the LZMA stream produced by 7-Zip and LZMA Utils differ, making them incompatible. Currently neither tool can use the files created by the opposite utility, at least for now. 7-Zip includes an additional 64-bit header entry containing the uncompressed filesize, which LZMA Utils does not add.

1943045,Puzzle box,"A puzzle box (also called a secret,or trick box) is a box which can only be opened by a non-obvious and sometimes complicated series of manipulations.  Sometimes, a simple squeeze at the right spot will do the trick. On the other hand, sometimes many movements of small pieces are necessary for the box to open. Hence some puzzle boxes are closely related to burr puzzles.  



Jewelry used to be kept in trick boxes so that a potential thief would have problems seeing and stealing the contents.  Puzzle boxes have been crafted all over the world, including Morocco, Poland and South America. By far the most intricate and beautiful is the Japanese puzzle box, covered in complicated patterns of rich wood inlay called Yosegi and featuring complex mechanisms to open them. At first glance they appear smooth and without any opening, but by various obvious or hidden panels, may take anywhere from 2 to over 200 movements to open.







The Japanese puzzle box can be as small as an inch long, or up to over a foot in length.  They are adorned with elaborate inlaid wooden geometric designs, an independent craft in itself. They are produced in a few towns in small area of Japan. The town of Hakone in particular is regarded as the center of both the creation and the continuing evolution of this National Traditional Handicraft as designated by the Minister of Industry in 1984. In Japan the boxes are known as ""Himitsu-Bako"" or ""Secret Box."" The exterior of the traditional Himitsu-Bako is covered by Yosegi, which is a paperthin series of designs glued together then pressed in a device which helps align the very intricate geometric designs formed by the incredible shapes, colors, and textures of the many kinds of wood used to make the final piece of yosegi that will cover the top, bottom, sides, and ends of the box. On some of the finest boxes the artisan uses a technique known as Moku-Zougan, which is a picture made of various woods and often based on some of the woodblock prints from the late 1700s. The majority of these boxes with pictures in wood are made up of three common scenes which in the 1780s  were clearly visible from Hakone #1) Mountains; Mt Fugiyama is easily visible from Hakone with its distinct white cap of snow #2) Trees; In and around Hakone are many species of trees; #3)  Water; If the water is seen from Hakone it is more than likely the water in Lake Ashino. Many if not most of these scenes show a house tucked into the trees with a boat on the lake and Mt. Fuji clearly visible in the background. San means 3 and sui represents the three elements of nature water, trees and mountains combined to form the Sansui scene familiar to almost everyone who grew up in the 1950s and through the 1970s.



These boxes were made in various complexities and consist basically of 4 moves with a variety of twists here and there to trick the person trying to open these exquisite boxes, but the real trick is finding the correct series of movements that can range from 2 to 125 moves.  Mr. Yoshio Okiyama is credited with making the most complex box which requires 125 moves to open. He also made boxes which require from 78 to 90, 102, 122 moves to open and his final box, made while he was in his late 70's, was a 119 move box with a wood picture of a Geisha on the top and a bow, as on a gift, on the bottom. Only 19 of these complex boxes were made for sale while another 8 in a different style were made for sale in foreign markets.  Mr. Okiyama passed away in March of 2003 approximately at the same time as another great Master of this craft, Mr. Kenji Suzuki. On the other end of the scale of complexity is the greatest Master Craftsman of them all, the famous Mr. Yoshiyuki Ninomiya, who makes the finest most perfectly made Himitsu-Bako to ever grace a collector's display area. Finding the Kannuki on one of his boxes is often nearly impossible to the untrained eye. Mr. Ninomiya has made fit and finish his life's work, at least in terms of the Himitsu-Bako.  For over 50 or 60 years now he has perfected the creation of these boxes to such a degree that he is far and away the finest woodworker of this craft.

237754,Publius Clodius Pulcher,"Publius Clodius Pulcher (born around 92 BC, died January 18, 52 BC), was a Roman politician, chiefly remembered for his feuds with Titus Annius Milo and Marcus Tullius Cicero and introducing the grain dole.  



Life.

Military career.

Born as Publius Claudius Pulcher, his military career was generally undistinguished.  He took part in the Third Mithridatic War under his brother-in-law, Lucullus.  However, considering himself treated with insufficient respect, he stirred up a revolt.  Another brother-in-law, Q. Marcius Rex, governor of Cilicia, gave him the command of his fleet, but he was captured by pirates. On his release he repaired to Syria, where he nearly lost his life during a mutiny he was accused of instigating.



Political life.

Returning to Rome in 65 BC, Clodius turned to a cursus honorum.  He prosecuted Catiline for extortion, but was bribed by him to procure acquittal. There seems no reason to believe that Clodius was involved in the Catilinarian conspiracy; indeed, according to Plutarch (Cicero, 29), he rendered Cicero every assistance and acted as one of his bodyguards. 



The affair of the mysteries of the Bona Dea, however, caused a breach between Cicero and Clodius in December 62 BC. Clodius, dressed as a woman (men were not admitted to the mysteries), entered the house of Julius Caesar (at the time pontifex maximus), where the mysteries were being celebrated.  It was suggested at the time that Clodius wore the disguise in order to carry on an intrigue with Pompeia Sulla, Caesar's wife. (Whether or not the allegation was true of Clodius' seeking an affair with Pompeia Sulla, Caesar divorced her in short order to avoid even the hint of impropriety in his spouse.) He was detected and brought to trial, but escaped condemnation by bribing the jury. Cicero's violent public statements on this occasion may have led Clodius to seek revenge.



Renounciation of Patrician rank.

On his return from Sicily (where he had been quaestor in 61 BC), Clodius chose to renounce his patrician rank.  After gaining the consent of the Roman Senate, and with the connivance of Caesar, he succeeded in being adopted into the plebeian branch of his gens by P. Fonteius in 59 BC.  On December 10, 59 BC, he was elected Tribune of the Plebs, an office for which patricians were ineligible.



Introduction of the grain dole.

His first act as tribune was to bring forward laws seemingly calculated to secure him popular favour. Grain, instead of being sold at a low rate, was to be distributed gratuitously once a month; the right of taking the omens on a fixed day and (if they were declared unfavourable) of preventing the assembly of the comitia, possessed by every magistrate by the terms of the Lex Aelia Fufia, was abolished; the old clubs or guilds of workmen were re-established; the censors were forbidden to exclude any citizen from the senate or inflict any punishment upon him unless he had been publicly accused and condemned.



Rise to power.

Clodius then acted against Cicero and Cato the Younger, who was sent to Cyprus as praetor to take possession of the island and the royal treasures. Cicero's property was confiscated by order of Clodius, his house on the Palatine burned down, and its site put up for auction. It was purchased by Clodius himself, who, not wishing his name to appear in the matter, had someone else place the bid for him. After the departure of Caesar for Gaul, Clodius practically became master of Rome with the aid of a personal gang, one of several that were active in the city at the time.  In 57 BC, one of the tribunes proposed the recall of Cicero, and Clodius resorted to force to prevent the passing of the decree.  His effort was foiled by Milo, who led an armed gang sufficiently strong to hold him in check. Clodius subsequently attacked the workmen who were rebuilding Cicero's house at public cost, assaulted Cicero himself in the street, and set fire to the house of Cicero's  brother Quintus Tullius Cicero.



In 56, while curule aedile, he impeached Milo for public violence (de vi) while defending his house against the attacks of Clodius' gang, and also charged him with keeping armed bands in his service. Judicial proceedings were hindered by violent outbreaks, and the matter was finally dropped.



Death.

In 53 BC, when Milo was a candidate for the consulship, and Clodius for the praetorship, the rivals collected armed bands and clashed in the streets of Rome.  On January 18 52 BC,  Clodius was slain near Bovillae.  His enraged clients used the senate house as his funeral pyre.



Family.

Clodius was born into the wealthy patrician family of Appius Claudius Pulcher and Caecilia Metella Balearica. He changed his name from the ancient patrician spelling of Claudius to the plebeian spelling of Clodius upon his adoption by P. Fonteius. Clodius was married to Fulvia, and had a daughter, Clodia Pulchra, who was briefly married to Octavian, and a son, also named P. Clodius.



His sister, Clodia, was immortalized in the poems of Gaius Valerius Catullus and the writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero; Cicero insinuated, in Pro Caelio, that Clodia had had an incestuous relationship with her brother.  She lived her life surrounded in perpetual scandal.



Clodius in popular culture.

 Clodius makes several appearances in Roma Sub Rosa, a series of novels by the American author Steven Saylor.

 Clodius is a particular enemy of Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger in the SPQR series of mysteries by John Maddox Roberts.

 Clodius is a key player in Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series books Caesar's Women and Caesar.  His entire exploits from his time in the east to his death in 52 BC is chronicled as a subplot to the greater story.

 Clodius plays a minor role in the Ides of March, an epistolatory novel by Thornton Wilder dealing with characters and events leading to, and culminating in the assassination of Julius Caesar. Clodius' possible involvement with Ceasar's second wife Pompeia and his attempt to attend the secret rites of the Bona Dea are mentioned (though these events are transplanted in time).

7733080,Christian Social Party (Germany),"The Christian Social Party (, CSP) was an anti-Semitic christian political party in the Deutsche Reich, founded in 1878 by Adolf Stoecker as the Christlichsoziale Arbeiterpartei (Christian Social Workers' Party).



The Christian Social Party combined a strong religious and monarchist programme with progressive ideas on labour, and tried to provide an alternative for disillusioned Social Democrat voters. 



In the 1878 elections, the party obtained less than 1% of the vote. Earlier, Johann Most led a large conjugation of Social Democrats in protesting against the party and its ""christianity."" 



Although anti-Semitism was only a minor theme in the early stages of the party, the anti-semitic message was carried by the so-called Berlin Movement (Berliner Bewegung) of the 1880s, which gathered considerable support. The CSP never gained mass support, but Adolf Stoecker was able to obtain a seat in the Reichstag after an electoral coalition with the Conservative Party. When the Conservatives became worried with the over-tones in Stoecker' anti-Semitic messages (although Stoecker's messages were more targeted at Reform Judaism than orthodox Judaism), the Christian Socialists were forced from the coalition in 1896.



The demise of the Christian Social Party came in the early 1900s. 



Most members of the CSP, under lead of Reichstag member Reinhard Mumm (who succeeded Adolf Stoecker in representing the Arnsberg constituency), stepped over to the German National People's Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei) in 1918. The group separated itself again, stepping over to the Christian Social People's Service (Christlich-Soziale Volksdienst) in 1929 after Alfred Hugenberg became the People's Party's president in 1928.

She started her own comic strip, Sazae-san, in 1946. It reached national circulation via the Asahi Shimbun in 1949 and ran daily until Hasegawa decided to retire in February, 1974. All of her comics were printed in Japan in digests of comic book form; by the mid-1990s, Hasegawa's estate had sold over 60 million copies in Japan alone.



Her comic strip was turned into a dramatic radio series in 1955 and a weekly animated series in 1969, which is still running in 2006.



Selected comics were translated into English, under the title The Wonderful World of Sazae-san.

494671,Optus Television,"Optus Television is the cable television division of Australian telecommunications company Optus.





History.

Its immediate predecessor was Optus Vision, a joint venture between its parent company, Optus, and the large local media companies Publishing and Broadcasting Limited and Seven Network. The Optus Vision joint venture was founded to handle residential cable television and local telephony, while its parent concentrated on corporate, long-distance, satellite and interstate communications.  Optus Vision used a unique hybrid cable to connect homes to its network, and later added broadband cable internet access to its network.



Unlike in most countries, Australian local governments did not create local cable monopolies. This meant that when cable TV became legal in the early 90s anyone with enough money could lay a cable network anywhere. Optus and Telstra were the two main telecommunications companies in Australia at the time, and both spent billions on hybrid coax and optic fibre networks in the major capital cities. Optus' network reached small parts of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, while Telstra's covered exactly the same territory plus more of those cities and tiny parts of Adelaide, Perth and the Gold Coast.



While the Optus network had Optus Vision, the Telstra network had Foxtel, a 50/50 joint venture with News Corporation. These competed heavily in the metropolitan areas. Both groups affiliated with another pay TV company, Austar, in the lower-profit rural areas. Austar was effectively given a monopoly in its territory.



Optus Vision had nearly total coverage of the country's popular sports tied up (through partially Seven Network owned Sportsvision and ESPN), a movie package equal to Foxtel, and exclusive rights to popular channels like Disney Channel and MTV Australia.



Optus proved that content is not always king. If people cannot get access to your content, eventually your content will end up somewhere that they can.



From 1995 to 1997, the Super League War waged between the two consortiums over lucrative rugby league rights. At the end of the war, Packer changed sides, becoming a 25% owner of Foxtel. Optus Vision was sold to Optus, and renamed ""Optus Television"".



In 2002 Optus let go of some of its exclusive content contracts, replacing them with non-exclusive ones. MTV Australia, Disney Channel and ESPN all became available on Foxtel as soon as they were able.



 Satellite Broadcasting .

Optus, along with Austar had a joint venture in the use of Satellite broadcasting for the delivery of Subscription Television. Originally, Foxtel had not previously offered a Satellite service, until purchasing the satellite subscribers from Australis Media within their service area. Until 2004, Foxtel was a customer of the Austar/Optus joint venture.



Optus utilised this joint venture to initially trial and subsequently offer a basic satellite service, named VIP. The service was very select with not many being able to access the service. The ability to offer the service came about due to Optus offering a large number of channels to East Coast Television (now apart of Austar). After Optus axed the VIP Service, it also sold its share in the joint venture to Austar.



In 2004, the roles reversed and Austar became the customer to Foxtel for satellite delivery.



Sport Programming.



Until 2002, Optus did not offer the Fox Sports sporting channels on their service as Foxtel and Austar did, instead offering channels from Sportsvision (later C7 Sport) and ESPN.



During the Super League/ARL war, Optus' sports channels had the rights to the ARL competition and the Super League rights were held by Fox Sports.



Seven bought Sportsvision, which became Optus and Austar exclusive C7 Sport and progressively lost sporting rights to Fox Sports. During that time Foxtel granted Optus an ""NRL Channel"", screening all of the NRL matches that had previously been shown exclusively on the Foxtel platform.



C7 Sport for some time had attempted to access the Foxtel platform for their service - however Foxtel were hesitant to accede to the request, with one exception being the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where C7 offered two extra channels dedicated to Olympics coverage.



In 2000, Seven and C7 Sport lost the AFL rights to a Nine/Ten and Foxtel-based consortium leaving C7 with only the Olympics and 6 Nations Rugby rights of major substance.



In 2002, the commencement of the new AFL broadcasting deal with Foxtel led Optus and Austar to drop C7 Sport from their services, leading to the demise of the channel. Optus replaced the C7 channels with an Optus rebadged version of Fox Sports.



The dropping of the C7 service has lead to Optus being a party in the action being taken by the Seven Network over the demise of the C7 Sport service.



 Subscriber Numbers .

For some time, Optus has not explicitly released subscriber numbers for their Optus Television service, however combining them with other services offered under the division that Optus Television is a part of.



Since December 2002, subscriber numbers have dropped considerably to almost half of the 241,000 reported.   Since that time, Optus has repositioned its television service to being a major component of bundled services, rather than a service by itself.



 Optus iTV Trials .

During 2002-03, Optus trialled interactive digital television over part of its Sydney network. This was known as Optus iTV. The service was unique to Optus and had a good deal of positive consumer feedback. The iTV service utilised the Liberate platform instead of OpenTV, as used by Foxtel Digital. The trials were canceled by Optus after the Content Supply Agreement was reached.



A notable difference between Optus iTV and Foxtel Digital was that the Optus system used the same HFC cable network both for delivery and for the return path, meaning no additional hardware or service was required for this return path.  By contrast, the Foxtel Digital system relies on a telephone connection for the return path.  The advantage of this system is that it is platform neutral, meaning that the same telephone-based return path can be used for both cable and satellite installations.



The Optus iTV system also allowed true video on demand.  Foxtel Digitial provides near video on demand, with featured content broadcast on multiple channels with staggered start times available at frequent intervals.



Other potential features of Optus iTV included e-mail and walled garden Internet access.



 Optus TV featuring Foxtel .

After sigining up to the Content Supply Agreement with Foxtel, Optus Television changed their channel lineup to reflect the offerings from Foxtel.   Optus were able to have a number of differences between their offering and the Foxtel offering, so that Optus could meet some contractual obligations they had, as well as satisfying a number of requirements placed on the organisation by the ACCC.



A number of channels that had previously been unique to Optus (in comparison to Foxtel) were removed from Optus' lineup as they competed with channels that Foxtel offered, other channels crossed from Optus to the Foxtel lineup.   Optus were required to have a number of channels that were unique to their service, though the flagged channels are now available on both platforms without any change in regulation nor penalty.



 Optus TV featuring Foxtel Digital .

In April 2005, Foxtel granted Optus the right to carry the ""Foxtel Digital"" platform - an expanded range of channels including some interactivity.  The service would be resold by Optus, utilising the same equipment as Foxtel (such as the Foxtel iQ PDR, NDS technologies for encryption and OpenTV for interactivity delivery).



This agreement also allows for non-exclusive resale rights to the Foxtel Digital service using Satellite Delivery within Foxtel's service area.



Commencing trials in November 2005, the service became fully operational in December of the same year.



Optus is believed to be permitting wholesale access to the network so third party broadcasters can sell subscription services over Optus cable.

They were Muthu Thandavar (?1560 - ?1640 CE), Arunachala Kavi (1712-1779) and Marimutthu Pillai (1717-1787), and lived five decades before the Tiruvarur Trinity or Trinity of Carnatic Music. They introduced several innovations that led to the evolution of the Carnatic Kriti (song).

987673,Rumtek Monastery,"Rumtek (), also called the Dharmachakra Centre, is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery located in the Indian state of Sikkim near the capital Gangtok. Originally built by the 9th Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje in 16th century, Rumtek served as the main seat of the Karma Kagyu lineage in Sikkim for some time. But when the 16th Karmapa arrived in Sikkim in 1959, after fleeing before the Chinese occupation of Tibet, it was in ruins. Despite being offered other sites, the Karmapa decided to rebuild Rumtek. To him, the site possessed many auspicious qualities and was surrounded by the most favorable attributes. For example, flowing streams, mountains behind, a snow range in front, and a river below. With the generosity and help of the Sikkim royal family and the Indian government, it has been built by the 16th Karmapa as his main seat in exile. 



After four years, construction of the monastery was completed. The sacred items and relics brought out from Tsurphu, the Karmapa's seat in Tibet, were installed. On Tibetan New Year's day (Losar) in 1966 the 16th Karmapa officially inaugurated the new seat called, ""The Dharmachakra Centre, a place of erudition and spiritual accomplishment, the seat of the glorious Karmapa."" 



The monastery is currently the largest in Sikkim. It is  home to the community of monks and where they perform the rituals and practices of the Karma Kagyu lineage. A Golden Stupa contains the  relics of the 16th Karmapa. Opposite that building is a college, Karma Shri Nalanda Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies.



Rumtek is located 24 km from Gangtok, the capital of the Sikkim, at an altitude of about 1500 m.



Rumtek is currently at the centre of the Karmapa controversy with a lengthy battle being played out in the Indian courts. Two rival organisations, both supporting different candidates for the 17th Karmapa claim stewardship of the monastery and its contents. The two organisations are the Karmapa Charitable Trust (supporting Thaye Dorje) and the Tsurphu Labrang (supporting Ogyen Trinley Dorje). Currently neither Karmapa candidate resides at Rumtek.

807003,Calcium phosphate,"Calcium phosphate is the name given to a family of minerals containing calcium ions (Ca2+) together with orthophosphates (PO43-), metaphosphates or pyrophosphates (P2O74-) and occasionally hydrogen or hydroxide ions.



Varieties.





Uses.

Calcium phosphate is an important raw material for the production of phosphoric acid and fertilizers, for example in the Odda process. Overuse of certain forms of calcium phosphate can lead to nutrient-containing surface runoff and subsequent adverse effects upon receiving waters such as algal blooms  and eutrophication.  



Calcium phosphate is also a raising agent, with E number E341. It is also used in cheese products. 



It is also used as a nutritional supplement.  There is some debate about the different bioavailabilities of the different calcium salts.



Another practical application of the compound is its use in gene transfection. The calcium ions can make a cell competent to allow exogenous genes to enter the cell by diffusion. A heat shock afterwards then induces the cell to repair itself. This is a quick and easy method for transfection, albeit a rather inefficient one.  Calcium chloride is also used for this purpose."
885805,Synod of Pistoia,"The Synod of Pistoia was a diocesan synod held in 1786 under the presidency of Scipione de' Ricci (1741-1810), bishop of Pistoia, and the patronage of Leopold, grand-duke of Tuscany, with a view to preparing the ground for a national council and a reform of the Tuscan Church.



On January 26 the grand-duke issued a circular letter to the Tuscan bishops suggesting certain reforms, especially in the matter of the restoration of the authority of diocesan synods, the purging of the missals and breviaries of legends, the assertion of episcopal as against papal authority, the curtailing of the privileges of the monastic orders, and the better education of the clergy.



In spite of the hostile attitude of the great majority of the bishops, Bishop de Ricci issued on July 31 a summons to a diocesan synod, which was solemnly opened on the September 18. It was attended by 233 beneficed secular and 13 regular priests, and decided with practical unanimity on a series of decrees which, had it been possible to carry them into effect, would have involved a drastic alteration of the Church on the lines advocated by Febronius.



The first decree (Decretum de fide et ecclesia) declared that the Roman Catholic Church has no right to introduce new dogmas, but only to preserve in its original purity the faith once delivered by Christ to His apostles, and is infallible only so far as it conforms to Holy Scripture and true tradition; the Church, moreover is a purely spiritual body and has no authority in things secular. Other decrees denounced the abuse of indulgences, of festivals of saints, and of processions and suggested reforms; others again enjoined the closing of shops on Sunday during divine service, the issue of service-books with parallel translations in the vernacular, a vernacularization of the Roman Rite and recommended the abolition of all monastic orders except that of St. Benedict, the rules of which were to be brought into harmony with modern ideas; nuns were to be forbidden to take the vows before the age of 40. The last decree proposed the convocation of a national council. Its claims and teachings incorporated many demands made by the Jansenist clergy previously, though the synod cannot be said to have been Jansenist in essence. 



These decrees were issued together with a pastoral letter of Bishop de Ricci, and were warmly approved by the grand-duke, at whose instance a national synod of the Tuscan bishops met at Florence on April 23, 1787. The temper of this assembly was, however, wholly different. The bishops refused to allow a voice to any not of their own order, and in the end the decrees of Pistoia were supported by a minority of only three. They were finally condemned at Rome by the bull Auctorem fidei of August 28, 1794. De' Ricci, deprived of the personal support of the grand-duke (now the emperor Leopold I), exposed to pressure from Rome, and threatened with mob violence as a suspected destroyer of holy relics, resigned his see in 1791, and lived in Florence as a private gentleman until his death. In May 1805, on the return of Pope Pius VII from Paris, he signed an act of submission to the papal decision of 1794.



De' Ricci's own memoirs, Memorie di Scipione de Ricci, vescovo di Prato e Pistoia, edited by Antonio Galli, were published at Florence in two volumes in 1865. Besides this, his letters to Antonio Marini were published by Cesare Guasti at Prato in 1857; these were promptly put on the Index. See also De Potter, Vie de Scipion de Ricci (2 vols., Brussels, 1825), based on a manuscript life and a manuscript account of the synod placed on the Index in 1823. There are many documents in Zobi, Storia civile della Toscana, vols. ii. and iii. (Florence, 1856). The acts of the synod of Pistoia were published in Italian and Latin at Pavia in 1788.

4380,Books of Kings,"The Books of Kings (Hebrew: Sefer Melachim          ) is a part of Judaism's Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible. It was originally written in Hebrew, and it was later included by Christianity as part of the Old Testament.  According to Biblical chronology, the events in the Book of Kings occured sometime around the 9th and 10th Century BCE. 



Contents.

It contains accounts of the kings of the ancient Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah.



They contain the annals of the Jewish commonwealth from the accession of Solomon till the subjugation of the kingdom by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians (apparently a period of about four hundred and fifty-three years). The Books of Kings synchronize with 1 Chronicles 28 - 2 Chronicles 36:21. While in the Chronicles greater prominence is given to the priestly or Levitical office, in the Kings greater prominence is given to the royal office.  Kings appears to have been written considerably earlier than Chronicles, and as such is generally considered a more reliable historical source.



The story of Adonijah (1 Kings 1:1-2:46) - During his old age, David spends his nights with Abishag, a woman appointed for the purpose of keeping him warm. Adonijah, a son of David, gathers attendants and persuades Joab and Abiathar to support his claim to be David's heir. Opposed to this are Zadok, Benaiah, Nathan, and Shimei, as well as the army generals, who favour Solomon, another son of David. Adonijah invites his supporters, neutral court officials, and his other brothers excepting Solomon, to the Zoheleth stone. Nathan persuades Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, to trick David into announcing that Solomon is his heir. After having done this, David has Solomon anointed as the next king. When Adonijah is told, he and his guests flee, and Adonijah seeks sanctuary at the Jerusalem altar. Begging not to be harmed by Solomon, Adonijah is only told that he won't be harmed if he is guiltless. Dying, David instructs Solomon to take revenge on Joab, a supporter of Adonijah, and Shimei, and to be kind to the sons of Barzillai. Adonijah approaches Bathsheba asking for a conciliatory gesture from Solomon, namely he asks for Abishag, but when Bathsheba asks Solomon about this, Solomon has Benaiah slaughter Adonijah. Abiathar, who had supported Adonijah, is then deposed from being head priest of the Jerusalem altar, and exiled to his homeland, and is replaced by Zadok. Joab, another of Adonijah's supporters, seeks sanctuary at the Jerusalem altar, but Solomon has Benaiah slaughter Joab at the altar itself. As for Shimei, Solomon orders him to remain in Jerusalem, but when Shimei later retrieves his servants who had fled to Gath, Solomon has Benaiah slaughter Shimei for leaving.



The Wisdom of Solomon (1 Kings 3:1-15 and 5:9-14) - After having cemented an alliance with Egypt by marrying the daughter of Pharaoh, Solomon went to Gibeon, to make sacrifices, as it was the most prominent of the high places at the time. Once Solomon has made the sacrifices, in a dream God appears to Solomon and grants him a wish, so Solomon asks for wisdom. Since Solomon asked wisely rather than asking for riches, his wish for wisdom is granted, and Solomon surpassed the Egyptians and Cedemites in wisdom, his fame spreading among the neighbouring nations. Solomon also uttered thousands of songs and proverbs. ;

Solomon's judgment (1 Kings 3:16-28) -Two prostitutes come to Solomon and ask him to settle an argument between them as to who is the mother of a particular baby. Solomon asks for a sword to cut the baby in half to be split between the two women. When the first prostitute tells him to give the baby to the other rather than kill it she proves herself to be the mother with her love for the child. Solomon gives her the baby.



Solomon's officials (1 Kings 4:1-19, and 5:7-8) - An extensive list is given of the officials of Solomon's court. The commissaries, one for each month of the year, provide the food for Solomon and his guests, as well as for his horses, and the various locations are listed that they source the food from. ;



The story of the construction of the Temple of Solomon (1 Kings 5:15-7:51): Hiram of Tyre, a ""friend"" (that is,  political ally) of David's, sends an embassy to Solomon, causing Solomon to propose to build a temple. Solomon and Hiram enter into a trade agreement so that Solomon can obtain the necessary raw materials. Solomon enlists several workers via conscription, and Solomon's men, those of Hiram, and the Gebalites (that is,  from Biblos), prepare the temple, of which an extensive description is given. Solomon also builds a palace for himself, which is described as well. A bronze worker, somewhat confusingly also called Hiram (named Hiram-abi by Chronicles, i.e. Hiram is my father), is brought from Tyre to do Solomon's metal work. Two columns - named Jachin and Boaz - are built next to the temple door, and the temple is generally designed like those of Hadad in Tyre's vassal states.



The story of the moving the Ark to the Temple (1 Kings 8:1-9:9) - The elders of Israel, and the Israelite princes, come to Solomon for the moving of the ark from Zion. While the priests move the ark, a sacrifice is made which is so substantial that it cannot be counted. Finally, when the ark arrives in the Temple, and the priests that had been carrying it return outside, a dark cloud fills the temple, which Solomon says is where Yahweh intends to dwell forever. Solomon then extracts a promise from Yahweh to uphold the Davidic covenant, and to return to the aid of the people if they sin but later repent.



The story of Cabul (1 Kings 9:10-14) - After twenty years of giving Solomon the supplies that he wished for, Hiram is given twenty cities in Galilee by Solomon, which became known as Cabul, since Hiram wasn't satisfied with them.



An account of Solomon's building projects (1 Kings 9:15-25) - Solomon uses slave labour to build several cities for storing supplies. Amongst these is Gezer, which had previously existed but was burnt to the ground by Pharaoh, who returned it to Solomon's ownership as a dowry. For this building programme, Solomon enslaved every Canaanite still living in the land. Solomon also builds Millo as soon as Pharaoh's daughter moves from Zion to her newly built palace. ;



The story of the Queen of Sheba (1 Kings 10:1-10, and 10:13) - The Queen of Sheba visits Solomon and tests his wisdom, bringing with her a large retinue, and precious expensive things. Solomon's replies leave her breathless at his wisdom, and she is further impressed by his waiters, and banquet, and therefore gives Solomon some of her precious things. Before she returns to her homeland, Solomon gives her everything that she asks for, and other presents. ;



Solomon's wealth (1 Kings 4:20-5:6, 9:26-28, 10:11-12, and 10:14-29) - Solomon's empire stretched all the way from the Euphrates to Egypt (though quite how it got this big is not explained), and the many vassal states paid him tribute. He also had extravagant banquets every day, and owned thousands of horses. Solomon built a fleet in Ezion-geber, near Elath, and Hiram staffs him with seamen, who collect a large amount of gold from Ophir and bring it to Solomon. Solomon uses the gold to make goblets and utensils and so forth, even creating a throne made from ivory and inlaid with gold. Hiram's fleet brings further expensive materials from Ophir besides the gold, such as ivory, silver (which, according to the text, at the time was worthless), and monkeys. In addition to the gold from Hiram's fleet, from merchants, and from the Arab kings, all the visitors to Solomon's court bring with them expensive tributes, hence Solomon grew richer than anyone else on earth. Solomon also traded horses.



Solomon's harem (1 Kings 11:1-13) - Apart from his Egyptian wife, Solomon also had over 700 wives and 300 concubines from nations that the Mizvot forbid intermarriage with. The wives make Solomon polytheistic, worshipping the gods of his wives, such as Astarte, Milcom, and Chemosh, even building high places to them opposite Jerusalem. So Yahweh promises Solomon that a part of the kingdom will be removed and given to another during the reign of Solomon's descendants. ;



The story of Hadad (1 Kings 11:14-22 and 11:25b) - Hadad, the sole survivor of King David's , fled to Egypt. Having won favour with the Pharaoh, Hadad was given in marriage to the sister of Queen Tahpenes, the wife of Pharaoh. Hadad and his wife have a son, whom Pharaoh brings up as his own. Hadad later requests permission from Pharaoh to return to his own country, and he becomes king of Edom. ;



Rezon (1 Kings 11:23-25a) - A man named Rezon fled from Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, when King David defeats Hazadezer's army. Rezon gathered a group of men and took over as king of Damascus, seceding from Solomon's empire.





The story of Rehoboam (1 Kings 11:41-12:1, 12:3-19, 12:20b-24, and 14:21-31a) - When Solomon died, his son, Rehoboam, was proclaimed king at Shechem. The people appeal to Rehoboam to have their servitude lightened, and so he seeks the advice first of the elders and then of the youths. The elders suggest complying with the wishes, but Rehoboam decides to go with the advice of the youths, namely to enforce even heavier servitude. This results in rebellion, and when Rehoboam sends out Adoram, the man in charge of forced labour, the people stone Adoram to death. Rehoboam is forced to flee to Jerusalem as only Judah remains loyal to him, and there he plans an attack using the army of Benjamin and Judah against the forces of Israel. However, a man of God, named Shemiah, is told by God to tell Rehoboam not to fight, and when Rehoboam is told this, he complies. Later in his reign, Shishak, the Pharaoh, attacks, looting the temple and palace, leaving Rehoboam compelled to use bronze to replace the golden shields of Solomon that Shishak had taken.



The story of Jeroboam (1 Kings 11:26-40, 12:2, and 12:25-32) - The man in charge of the work force from the house of Joseph, Jeroboam, bumps into Ahijah, a prophet from Shiloh, when Jeroboam's task, the construction of Millo, is complete. Ahijah spontaneously tore his cloak into twelve parts and gave ten pieces to Jeroboam as a symbol of God's will, explaining that the division is owing to Solomon turning to heathen practices. Solomon subsequently tries to have Jeroboam killed for treason, but he escapes to the protection of the Egyptian Pharaoh, only returning when he hears that Solomon's son has succeeded him as king. When Israel rebels against Rehoboam, they appoint Jeroboam as their new king, and Jeroboam establishes Shechem as his capital and then moves to Penuel. However, Jeroboam perceives that a religion centralised at Jerusalem, particularly the annual pilgrimage to there, is a threat to independence, and so establishes cult centres at the very edges of his own kingdom, putting up golden calves at Bethel and at Dan, saying ""here is your God"". Jeroboam also appoints non-Levites to the priesthood. ;



The story of the fasting man of God (1 Kings 12:33-13:34) - At a rival ceremony in Bethel to the traditional one at Jerusalem, Jeroboam prepares to make a sacrifice. At that moment, a man of God (who is not named), prophesies to Jeroboam about a future destruction of the priests and worship at Bethel. Jeroboam orders that the man be seized, but his arm freezes and the altar collapses, so Jeroboam takes this as a sign and appeals to the man of God. The man of God restores Jeroboam's arm, but refuses Jeroboam's hospitality as the man of God was ordered to fast by God, and to return home immediately. An old prophet from Bethel (who is not named) follows the man of God, and offers his own hospitality, but it too is rejected. Then the old prophet states that God had told him to offer his hospitality, so the man of God accepts, but is killed by a lion as he had broken the fast. Then the old prophet mourns the man, buries him, and requests to be buried in the same grave.



The story of Abijah of Israel (1 Kings 14:1-20) - Jeroboam's son and heir, Abijah, becomes sick, so Jeroboam sends his wife, in disguise, to the prophet Ahijah, to ask what can be done. Ahijah replies that Jeroboam's Canaanite practices have condemned his dynasty to destruction, and Abijah is doomed from the moment the wife returns to the son. Duly, when the wife returns to Tirzah and enters her house, the son dies.



The story of Abijah of Judah (1 Kings 14:31b-15:8a) - After Rehoboam dies, Abijah (named as Abijam in Kings but Abijah in Chronicles), his son, succeeds him as king of Judah. Abijam appears to be the grandson (or otherwise a descendant) of Absalom by his mother's side. Abijam continued the war against Jeroboam to conquer Israel. A more full account of the war is given in Chronicles.



The story of Asa of Judah (1 Kings 15:8b-24a): Abijam's son, Asa, succeeds him as king of Judah, and he quickly deposed Maacah, his grandmother, from having any authority, as she supports the Canaanite religious practices. Asa also burns his grandmother's asherah. During Asa's reign there is a perpetual war between him and Baasha, the king of Israel, who Ben-hadad, king of Aram, was supporting. Asa bought Ben-hadad's loyalty by sending him what remained of the treasures of the temple and his palace, so Ben-hadad changes sides and attacks several cities, and the regions of the tribes of Dan and Naphtali. Baasha retreats to his capital rather than continue fortifying Raamah, so Asa dismantles the fortifications and uses them to build Geba. In his old age, Asa had infirm feet. ;



The story of Baasha (1 Kings 15:25-16:6a) - When Jeroboam died, his son, Nadab, took over as king of Israel. However, Baasha, the son of Ahijah, plots against Nadab, and while Nadab is besieging Gibbethon. Becoming king in Nadab's stead, Baasha then slaughters all the remaining relatives of Jeroboam. During Baasha's reign, there is a permanent war between Asa and Baasha, and although Ben-hadad originally supported Baasha, he changed to Asa's side, capturing several large areas of the land, and causing Baasha to retreat back to his capital, Tirzah. A prophet, named Jehu, is told by Yahweh that Baasha's actions are to be condemned, so Jehu tells Baasha. ;



The story of Zimri (1 Kings 16:6b-20) - After the death of Baasa, he is succeeded by his son, Elah. However, one of his leading commanders, Zimri, plots against him, and while Elah is getting drunk, Zimri strikes him dead. Zimri then slaughters all the remaining relatives of Baasa and takes over the throne of Israel. The army, however, proclaim Omri, their general, as the king, and lay siege to Tirzah, where Zimri is located. Zimri decides to burn his palace to the ground, killing himself.



The story of Omri (1 Kings 16:15b-19, 16:21-28a) Having been proclaimed king by the army, Omri besieges Zimri, who then dies in a fire. Subsequently, only half of Israel support Omri, the other half supporting a man named Tibni, to be king. The civil war ends with Omri and his supporters as victor. Omri later constructs a new capital at Samaria, and moves there. Despite the many monumental achievements and constructions that are archaeologically attributed to the period normally identified for his reign, the Book of Kings neglects to mention any of these, preferring to portray Omri as an insignificant heretic that happened to become king and then, later, die.



The story of Elijah and the widow (1 Kings 17:1-24) God ordains that no rain shall fall while he is served by a man from Tishbe, named Elijah, or at least this is the case according to Elijah. Elijah is sent to a stream, and fed by ravens, day and night, but when the stream dries up, due to the lack of rain, he is sent on to a widow, who will wait on him. Demanding from the widow water and bread, Elijah is met with the response that there is not enough flour or oil. Elijah, however, promises that the flour and oil will last until the rains return, which comes true. The widow's son later grows sick, and stops breathing, so she accuses Elijah of making this happen. Elijah responds by laying out the son's body on his own bed, stretching himself over on the body three times, and then praying, whereupon the son comes back to life.



The story of Elijah and the prophets of Ba'al (1 Kings 16:28b-33, and 18:1-46) - After the death of Omri, his son, Ahab, becomes the king. Ahab marries Jezebel, and worships Hadad (often referred to by the epithet Ba'al - meaning lord), building a totem and temple to his worship. Jezebel slaughters the prophets of Yahweh, though some are rescued by Obadiah, Ahab's vizier. Meanwhile, the famine grows bitter, and Elijah is sent by God to Ahab, with Obadiah joining him on his way. When Elijah and Ahab meet, they trade insults, with Elijah calling Ahab a sinner due to his religious practices, and Ahab calling Elijah the disturber of Israel. Elijah then challenges Hadad worship, demanding all of Israel attend mount Carmel. At Carmel, Elijah announces he will sacrifice a bull to Yahweh, and he expects that the worshippers of Hadad will sacrifice a bull to Hadad, stating that the real god will respond. When there is no response from the sacrifice to Baal, which Elijah mercilessly mocks, he rebuilds the older altar to Yahweh, makes the sacrifice, and a fire appears from heaven and consumes it. The people convert from worship of Hadad to that of Yahweh en-masse, and Elijah has the throats of the prophets of Hadad slit at a river. A storm subsequently gathers, and Elijah and Ahab race to Jezreel, Elijah staying in front.



The story of Hiel and the rebuilding of Jericho (1 Kings 16:34) - During the reign of Ahab, a man named Hiel rebuilds Jericho from its ruins. However, his sons die during construction, fulfilling a prophecy that Joshua had made.



The story of Elijah's flight to Horeb (1 Kings 19:1-21) - After Ahab has told Jezebel what has happened, she seeks revenge against Elijah, who flees Beer-sheba, and goes into the desert. Elijah prays for death, but is ordered by an angel to eat and drink, so he walks for 40 days and nights to Horeb. On the mountain, there are a series of phenomona (that could easily be a dramatic description of a volcano), and then a faint whisper asking Elijah why he is present. After Elijah explains, he is ordered to go to anoint Hazael as the next king of Aram (Elisha does this as well), Jehu as king of Israel (Elisha does this as well), and Elisha as his own successor, and to demand that they slaughter everyone except those who devoutly worship Yahweh. Elisha, a plowman, readily follows Elijah, even killing his oxen, and burning them as a sacrifice, having broken up his plowing equipment to use as fuel.



The story of the first siege of Samaria (1 Kings 20:1-21) - Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, lays siege to Samaria, and Ahab gives up his treasure, harem, and sons. Ben-hadad then further demands to be allowed to ransack Ahab's property, but the elders of Israel disuade Ahab from agreeing, angering Ben-hadad. A prophet arrives and tells Ahab that he will win, so Ahab gathers the army of Israel together, and they launch a surprise attack, causing the Aramaeans to flee. ;



The story of the battle of Aphek (1 Kings 20:22-43) - The servants of Ben-hadad tell him to attack on the plains, as the God of Israel is one of mountains, so Ben-hadad does just this, going to Aphek, but the prophet returns and tells Ahab that he will win, so Ahab gathers his army, and strikes down the enemy. The aramaeans flee into the city of Aphek, but its walls collapse. The servants of Ben-hadad tell him that the kings of Israel are merciful, so they are sent to Ahab to beg for mercy, and Ahab grants it. Meanwhile, on the orders of Yahweh, a prophet tells a companion to strike him, but the companion refuses, so the companion is killed by a lion. Once again the prophet tells a (different) companion to strike him, but this time the companion does so, and wounds him. The prophet pretends to the king that he was wounded in battle, and that he had been told to guard another man, on pain of death, but the other man escaped. The king of Israel consequently tells the prophet that he has condemned himself, but the prophet tells the king that the king has condemned himself, as the prophet had doomed Ben-hadad to destruction, and mercy wasn't approved by God.



The story of Naboth's vineyard (1 Kings 21:1-29) - A vineyard by the palace of Ahab is owned by a man named Naboth, but Ahab tries to buy it for a reasonable price and exchange of land, so that he can turn it into a vegetable garden. Naboth, however, refuses to give up his ancestral land, which angers Ahab, and causes Jezebel to arranges for Naboth to be falsely accused of blasphemy and treason, and for him to be stoned to death. Once Naboth has been killed, Jezebel tells Ahab, and he sets off for Naboth's vineyard, but meets Elijah there. Elijah prophecies that Ahab's dynasty will be eaten by dogs and by the birds. Ahab then tears his clothes, so Elijah is told by Yahweh that Ahab's penitance has bought him time.



The story of the Battle of Ramoth-gilead (1 Kings 22:1-40a, and 22:54) - After a period of peace between Aram and Israel, Jehoshaphat of Judah approaches the king of Israel and enters a pact to help take back Ramoth-gilead from Aram. Jehoshaphat asks for consultation with a prophet that is not one of the yes-men, the only one meeting this requirement being Micaiah (son of Imlah), who the (unidentified) king of Israel hates. Zedekiah (son of Chenaanah) made horns of iron to kill the king of Aram with. Despite the other prophets predicting success, Micaiah predicts total failure, so Zedekiah slaps him. The king of Israel orders Micaiah to be seized and put in prison until the king returns from the war, and then disguises himself to enter the battle. Conversely, the king of Aram orders his men to only attack the king of Israel, and though some mistake Jehoshaphat for the king, his battle cry makes them realise he is not. A randomly fired arrow, by fluke, hits the disguised king of Israel, and he eventually dies from blood loss as the battle rages around him. The king's body is washed at the pool of Samaria, and the blood on his chariot is licked up by the dogs, fulfilling Elijah's prophecy about Ahab.



The story of Jehoshaphat (1 Kings 15:24b and 22:41-51a): Jehosaphat succeeds his father, Asa, as king of Judah. Although Jehoshaphat worships Yahweh, he permits the high places to continue existing. Like Solomon, Jehoshaphat sent ships to Ophir for gold, but this time they were recked at Ezion-gezer. ;



The story of Ahaziah of Israel (1 Kings 22:40b, and 1 Kings 22:52-2 Kings 1:18) - Ahaziah, Ahab's son, succeeds him as king of Israel. Ahaziah falls through the lattice of his roof terrace, and so sends messengers to ask the god of Ekron that he worships, Hadad (referred to as Ba'al and Baalzebub, a satirical corruption of Baalzebul - prince Baal), if he would recover from the injury. Elijah is sent by an angel to intercept the messengers, and to tell them that Ahaziah is doomed. The men are duly informed by Elijah, and are sent back to Ahaziah. After hearing them describe Elijah, Ahaziah recognises that Elijah gave them the message, so he sends men to ask Elijah to visit him. Elijah then prophecies that the men will be killed by divine fire, and this duly occurs. Ahaziah again sends men to Elijah, and again Elijah prophecies, and the men are immediately killed by divine fire. The third time men are sent, their leader begs Elijah to listen, and an angel tells Elijah to go with them, so he does, and tells Ahaziah that he will die to his face, which comes true.



The story of the last days of Elijah (2 Kings 2:1-18) - Elisha and Elijah are on their way to Gilgal, but Elijah tells Elisha to remain, but Elisha insists on going with him. On reaching Bethel, the prophets there tell Elisha that God is due to take Elijah on that day, but Elisha insists he already knows. Elijah tells Elisha to remain, but Elisha again insists on going with him. And so they go to Jericho, where the same events occur. At the Jordan, Elijah rolls up his mantle and touches the waters, which duly part, and the two cross on dry land. A flaming chariot and horses then come and collect Elijah and take him to heaven. Elisha then picks up Elijah's mantle, which had fallen, strikes the waters of the Jordan, which part, and then crosses back over. ;



Stories of the minor miracles of Elisha (2 Kings 2:19-24, 4:1-7, 4:38-44, and 6:1-7) Once, the inhabitants of the city (not explicitly identified, but implicitly assumable to be Jericho) complain to Elisha about the poor state of the water and the land, so Elisha sprinkles salt on a spring to purify it, as it is ""to this day"". Elisha goes to Bethel, where a large number of small boys shout ""baldy"" at him, so Elisha curses them. Because of this insult, God sends two bears come out of the forest to tear 42 of the boys to pieces, killing them. A widow of a member of the prophet's guild complains to Elisha that her husband's creditors want to enslave her children to pay his debts, so Elisha tells her to fill as many vessels as possible with the oil that she owns, and to sell it, and miraculously the small amount of oil fills all the containers that she is able to find. During a famine, Elisha has his servants make vegetable stew for the guild of prophets at Gilgal, but one of them adds wild gourds to the stew. When realising that they have been poisoned, the guild complains to Elisha, who adds grain to the pot, and serves it to the people instead, who suffer no ills. A man from Baal-shalishah brings Elisha twenty loaves, and Elisha manages to feed a hundred people with them, miraculously dividing each loaf between five people, and there are some left-overs. The guild of prophets move to the Jordan to build themselves a larger home, and while doing so the head slips off an axe into the river, but Elisha throws a stick in and the iron axe head floats to the surface.



The story of Jehoram of Israel (2 Kings 1:17b and 3:1-27): - Due to Ahaziah (king of Israel) being childless, upon his death, his brother, Jehoram, succeeds him as king of Israel. Moab stops sending tribute to Israel once Jehoram takes over, and raises its army against Israel. Jehoram responds by makes a pact with Judah, and the combined forces of Israel, Judah, and Edom (a vassal of Judah), set out to attack Moab. However, the water supply dries up, and they consult Elisha for help. Elisha reluctantly agrees to assist them, and, going into a trance, prophecies water and victory. Vast quantities of water then come from the direction of Edom, filling the wells, and covering the ground. From a distance, the Moabites, mistaking the water for blood, think that Israel, Judah, and Edom, have attacked each other, so the Moabites seek out the spoils. When the Moabites reach the camp of Israel, the Israelites launch a surprise attack, vanquish the Moabites, and cast stones on their fields and block their springs. The Moabites are entrapped in a city, and is besieged, so the king, having failed to escape to get reinforcements, sacrifices his son to Chemosh. The sacrifice results in Israel being defeated. Jehoram later joins Ahaziah (king of Judah) in battle against Aram, but while recovering from the wounds inflicted in the battle is killed in a conspiracy, in which Ahaziah is also killed.



The story of Elisha and the Shunemite woman (2 Kings 4:8-37 and 8:1-6) - When Elisha visits Shunem, an influential woman asks him to dine with her, and consequently he dined with her each time he was in Shunem. The woman decides to prepare a room for him so that he can stay overnight, and so Elisha asks his servant how he can repay the woman. The servant tells Elisha that the woman is childless and her husband is old, so Elisha tells the woman that she will become pregnant, which comes true. Years later, while reaping the fields, the child, a boy, complains that his head hurts, and then abruptly dies. The mother sets off to find Elisha to tell him, and when Elisha is informed, he sends his servant to put the staff of Elisha on top of the boy. The boy remains dead, so Elisha himself goes to the boy, and twice lies on top of him, placing his hands in the boy's hands and his lips on the boy's lips, and the boy's body becomes warm. The third time he lies on the boy, the boy sneezes and awakens. Elisha later warns the woman, who has become a widow, of an approaching seven year famine, so she leaves the land. After the famine is over, the woman returns, and happens to pass the king at exactly the same moment that Elisha's servant is telling the king about the resurrection of the woman's son. The king consequently assigns an official to her, and orders that the woman's land be restored to her.



The story of Naaman (2 Kings 5:1-27) - Naaman, commander of Aram's forces, captured a girl from Israel during one of his campaigns. The girl tells Naaman, who suffers from leprosy, that Elisha can heal him. The king of Aram therefore sends Naaman to Elisha with letters of recommendation. Elisha orders Naaman to wash in the Jordan sevenfold, which angers Naaman, since there were closer rivers, but he is persuaded to wash in the Jordan anyway, and is cured. Naaman asks Elisha how he can be repayed, but all Elisha will accept is dedication to Yahweh alone, which Naaman agrees to. Elisha's servant thinks this a bit too light, so he goes after Naaman and suggests he donate money and two festal garments, which Naaman does. However, when the servant returns to Elisha, Elisha is angry about his action and curses Gehazi with the leprosy that Naaman had had.



The story of the Battle of Dothan (2 Kings 6:8-23) Once upon a time (c.f. the masoretic text of 2 Kings 6:8), the (unidentified) king of Aram was at war with the (unidentified) king of Israel, but Elisha told the king of Israel all of the secret plans that the king of Aram had made, so undermining his tactics. The king of Aram is angered by this and so sends an army to kill Elisha at Dothan. Elisha is not worried by this turn of events, and shows his servant that he is defended by a mountainside full of chariots of fire and horses, that were hidden from the servant's view. Elisha, by a prayer, strikes the army of Aram blind, then leads them to Samaria, where he restores their sight. At Samaria, Elisha orders the king of Israel to be hospitable to the Aramaean army, and not to harm them. After a feast, the Aramaeans leave, and the Aramaeans never return again to Israel.



The story of the second siege of Samaria (2 Kings 6:24-7:20) Somewhat contradicting the previous sentence, Ben-hadad, king of Aram, lays siege to Samaria. The siege causes inflation, and a famine that is so severe that some people have started eating other people's children. The (unnamed) king of Israel blames Yahweh for the tragedy, and refuses to trust Yahweh anymore, but Elisha prophecies that the an assassin has been sent against the king of Israel, and also that the inflation will end, and reverse. Four lepers realise that staying neutral, or entering the famished Israelite city, is a no-win situation for them, so they decide to go to the king of Aram, since at least there is a chance of survival. The lepers discover that the Aramaeans had fled, having mistaken some sounds for a large army, and fearing that Israel had hired Hittite and borderland mercenaries. After helping themselves to the food and treasure, the lepers decide to tell the people of Samaria that the Aramaeans have gone. Although the king of Israel does not believe them, his servants check for themselves, and when it becomes known to the rest of the population, the Aramaean camp is plundered, ending the famine.



The story of the accession of Hazael (2 Kings 8:7-15) - When Ben-hadad, king of Aram, lies sick, Elisha happens to be visiting Aram by chance. The king therefore sends Hazael to consult Elisha about the king's illness. Elisha is uneasy, prophesying that the king will not survive, and Hazael will become the new king and slaughter the Israelites. Hazael is shocked, and questions how he could become king (despite Elijah already having anointed him as the next king of Aram, some while ago), but when he returns, he lies to Ben-hadad and says that Elisha had prophesied a recovery. The next day, Hazael smothers the king to death with a water soaked cloth, and becomes king in his place. ;



The story of Jehoram of Judah (1 Kings 22:51b and 2 Kings 8:16-24a) - Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, succeeds him as king of Judah. Jehoram makes a pact with Israel, marrying into their royal family, though this results in him following their religious practices rather than the more Yahwistic ones of his own father. Edom, previously on Judah's side, revolts, and so Jehoram battles them, but is surrounded. Jehoram manages to escape, but his army flees, and Edom gains its independence. The town of Libnah also revolts against Jehoram. ;



The story of Ahaziah/Jehoahaz of Judah (2 Kings 8:24b-29 and 9:27-29) When Jehoram (king of Judah) dies, his son, named as Ahaziah in Kings and as Jehoahaz in Chronicles (both names are equivalent, they are the same theophory as suffix and prefix respectively), rules over Judah in his place. Due to their family connection, Ahaziah supports Jehoram (king of Israel) at the battle of Ramoth-Gilead against Hazael, and later visits Jehoram while he is convalescing from his battle wounds. While visiting the convalescent, the forces of Jehu attack him and he flees, but is fatally wounded, and dies at Megiddo.



The story of Jehu (2 Kings 9:1-10:31) - Elisha sends a prophet to anoint Jehu, a son of Jehoshaphat, as the king (despite Elijah already having done this). Once the prophet does this, Jehu organises a conspiracy against Jehoram (king of Israel), who was recovering at Jezreel from wounds inflicted by Hazael. When Jehu's troops approach Joram, Joram sends messengers to meet Jehu, but as Jehu forbids them to return to Joram, Joram is forced to meet Jehu himself. They meet in the field of Naboth, and Jehu accuses Jehoram's mother, Jezebel, of fornication and witchcraft, so Jehoram flees shouting that this is treason. However, on his way back, Jehoram is shot dead by Jehu with an arrow, and his body is taken to the field of Naboth in order to fulfil a prophecy. Ahaziah, the king of Judah, sees this, and flees, but is mortally wounded by Jehu, and dies at Meggido. Jehu heads to Jezreel, and when she learns of this, Jezebel puts on makeup, and calls down accusing him of murder, and asking if all is well. Jehu shouts out and persuades the palace eunuchs to defenestrate Jezebel, sending her to a gory death. Jehu challenges Israel to oppose him, but, frightened by him, they submit, and in accordance with his wishes, decapitate all the descendants of Ahab, sending Jehu the heads. Jehu also slaughters every descendant in Jezreel, and kills the kinsmen of Ahaziah (king of Judah) in a pit. Jehu then tricks the worshippers of Hadad (also known as Ba'al) by promising that he will worship Hadad, asking for them to gather at the temple of Hadad to make a sacrifice, evicting all the worshippers of Yahweh from the temple, closing the doors, and then slaughtering everyone inside. The temple of Hadad is then destroyed, and turned into a toilet. ;



The story of Jehoahaz of Israel (2 Kings 10:32-35a, and 13:1-9a) During Jehu's reign, Hazael conquers Gilead. After Jehu dies, his son, Jehoahaz, becomes the new king, of the much reduced Israel. Under the yoke of Hazael, Jehoahaz appeals to Yahweh, and a saviour is sent to free Israel from Hazael (at no point does it explain who this saviour is, or what they do to save Israel). Hazael's aggression has resulted in Jehoahaz's army being reduced to a pittance.



The story of Athaliah (2 Kings 11:1-20) - Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, on discovering the death of her son, sets out to kill the entire remaining royal family, and take the throne herself. However, her sister manages to hide Jehoash (sometimes abbreviated as Joash), the son of Ahaziah, in the temple of Yahweh. Six years later, the priest summons the captain of the guards and Carian mercenaries, and shows them Jehoash. The priest has the guards and mercenaries surround the temple and defend it, while he publicly anoints Jehoash as king. Although Athaliah discovers this, and shouts that this is treason, the priest has Athaliah taken away and killed. The people then go and obliterate the temple of Hadad, and slaughter its priest. ;



The story of Jehoash of Judah (2 Kings 12:1-22a) - Jehoash becomes a king loyal to the worship of Yahweh, though not insistent on centralised worship, and passes a law that the temple priests should get to keep the money offered at the temple, on the condition that they also take responsibility for carrying out repairs to it. While they keep the money, they fail to make repairs, so the king complains, and the priests choose to reject the money rather than be responsible for repairs. The money is put into a chest and when it becomes full, the contents are smelted together and used to pay for repairs, which a separate individual is given oversight of. Ironically, after Hazael successfully besieges Gath, when he mounts an attack on Jerusalem, Jehoash is forced to buy him off with the treasures from the temple. In a later conspiracy, Jehoash is killed by his own men.



The story of Jehoash of Israel (2 Kings 13:9b-13a, 13:13c-25 and 14:13-16a): Jehoash succeeds Jehoahaz, his father, as king of Israel. Jehoash goes to Elisha, who is dying, for help against Hazael. Elisha forces Jehoash to shoot an arrow through the window, and then prophecies that his doing so has ensured victory against Hazael. Elisha also makes Jehoash strike the ground with some arrows, and so Jehoash does so three times. Elisha states that this will ensure three victories, but by not striking the ground five or six times, has denied himself total outright victory. Elisha then dies, and is buried. While another funeral is taking place, Moabite raiders attack, so the mourners drop the body into Elisha's grave and flee, but when the body touches Elisha's, the man comes back to life. Hazael dies and is succeeded by the weaker Ben-hadad, who is defeated thrice by Jehoash, fulfilling Elisha's promise. Jehoash is later forced to fight the aggressive king of Judah, but succeeds and captures him. Jehoash goes on to Jerusalem where part of the walls are torn down, and Jehoash takes the treasure of the palace and temple. ;



The story of Amaziah (2 Kings 12:1-22b, 14:1-14 and 14:17-21) - Amaziah, the son of Jehoash (the king of Judah), succeeds him as king of Judah. Amaziah slaughters those who killed his father, though is merciful enough to spare their descendants. Amaziah then goes on military campaigns, conquering the Edomites. Amaziah challenges Jehoash (the king of Israel), but Jehoash responds with a parable about the Thistle of Lebanon. Amaziah attacks anyway, and the two sides meet in battle, but Judah is defeated, and Amaziah is captured. Later, Amaziah, now free (without explanation), hears of a conspiracy against him, so flees to Lachish, but is pursued there and killed.



The story of Jeroboam (II) (2 Kings 13:13b and 14:23-29a) - Jeroboam becomes king of Israel after the death of Jehoash (the king of Israel), his father. Despite following Canaanite religion (for which the books of Kings, Chronicles, Hosea, Joel, Amos, and Jonah, condemn him), Jeroboam is otherwise a hero, as he manages to expand the boundaries of Israel as far as the Arabah, and defeats Aram, returning Hamath to Israelite control, as had been prophesied. ;



The story of Uzziah (2 Kings 14:22, 14:29b-15:7b, 15:32-36, and 15:38a) - The son of Amaziah, Uzziah (Kings mistakenly names him Azariah, which in Chronicles is instead the name of his high priest), succeeds him as king of Judah, and rebuilds Elath. However, Uzziah suffers from leprosy, so his son, Jotham, reigns as regent (Chronicles states that Uzziah was deposed by a rebellion of the priesthood, and was cursed with leprosy as a result, and sent to live with the lepers). The construction of a gate of the temple is attributed to Jotham's mother. Jotham formally becomes king when Uzziah actually dies.



The story of Menahem (2 Kings 15:8-22a) - Jeroboam is succeeded by Zechariah, his son, as king of Israel, but Zechariah is soon killed by Shallum, who reigns in his place. Menahem hears about the assassination, and sets off to kill Shallum, but is held up by the people of Tappuah. After finally reaching Shallum, and killing him, Menahem exacts revenge on the people of Tappuah by slaughtering their entire population. Now that Menahem has become king, the king of Assyria, Tiglath-pileser (referred to in 15:16-22a as if a different individual named Pul, though this is actually just the throne name of Tiglath-pileser) invades and Menahem gives him money to employ him to strengthen Menahem's own reign over Judah, but Tiglath-pileser just leaves with the money (In an inscription, Tiglath-pileser describes this simply as him invading, forcing Menahem to become a vassal, and receiving tribute). Menahem taxes the population to raise the funds for the tribute.



The story of Pekah (2 Kings 15:22b-31 and 15:37) - When Menahem dies, his son, Pekahiah, succeeds him as king. However, Pekah, the adjutant to Pekahiah, conspires with the people from the eastern half of Israel, Gilead, and kills Pekahiah, becoming king in his place. Pekah enters into an alliance with Rezin, the king of Aram, to attack Judah. Supporting Judah, now a vassal of Assyria, Tiglath-pileser invades Israel, capturing several cities, and deporting their populations. Hoshea conspires against Pekah, killing him and becoming king in his place (though an inscription by Tiglath-pileser states that he killed Pekah and placed Hoshea on the throne himself).



The story of Ahaz (2 Kings 15:38b-16:20a) - Ahaz becomes king of Judah when Jotham, his father, dies. The alliance between Aram and Israel besiege Ahaz, and Edom is able to recover Elath, so Ahaz responds by becomes a vassal of Tiglath-pileser, who is subjugating Israel. Tiglath-pileser then attacks Damascus (capital of Aram), killing Rezin, and deporting the inhabitants to another part of Assyria. Ahaz follows Canaanite religious practices, sacrificing at the high places and Asherah groves, and even immolating his son through the fire to Moloch. As a consequence, when Ahaz goes to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser, he is so impressed by the altar that he has a new altar made to the same design, and replaces the altar at the Jerusalem temple with it. Ahaz makes further alterations to the temple layout, even removing the throne emplacement, in deference to the Assyrian king.



The story of the Lost Ten Tribes (2 Kings 17:1-41 and 18:9-12) After taking control of what remained of Israel, Hoshea is forced to become a vassal of the Assyrians, due to aggressive behaviour by Shalmaneser V (unnumbered in the Bible). However, Hoshea resents this, and not only fails to send the annual tribute to Assyria, but also sends envoys to Sais, the Egyptian king, for help. In consequence, Shalmaneser occupies Israel and besieges Samaria for three years. Samaria falls to Sargon II (the new king of Assyria after Shalmaneser dies during the siege, though the Bible does not indicate this, and refers to him simply as the king of Assyria without acknowledging that this is not Shalmaneser), and the nine tribes of Israel are completely deported to other regions of the Assyrian empire, becoming the Lost Ten Tribes (tradition considers there to be ten lost tribes, though Israel contained only nine). The writer remarks that the exile of Israel is punishment for it following heathen practices. Sargon uses other Assyrian people to populate the now fairly empty Israel, and they worship their own gods, though Sargon sends a few Israelite priests back to teach the Israelite religion, which becomes regarded by the new population polytheistically. ;



The story of Hezekiah's reform (2 Kings 16:20b, and 18:1-6) The son of Ahaz, Hezekiah, succeeds him as king of Judah, and institutes a far reaching religious reform, centralising the religion to the temple at Jerusalem. In iconoclastic pursuit of the reform, Hezekiah destroyed the high places, pillars, and Asherah, as well as the Nehustan, which Moses himself is alleged to have created.



An account of the Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem (2 Kings 18:13-19:37) - Hezekiah rebels against Assyria and partially subjugates the land of the Philistines (2 Kings 18:8). However, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, captures several cities in Judah, and so Hezekiah uses the temple funds, even breaking up the gold plated doors, to pay tribute to Sennacherib. Sennacherib sends messengers to Jerusalem to say that Hezekiah's ally Egypt is weak, that Hezekiah has offended Israel's God, and that Jerusalem couldn't even muster two thousand men to fight against the oncoming Assyrians (he makes his point by offering to supply the horses if Jerusalem can find the men). Sennacherib offers a the people a life of ease if they will submit, but the people of Judah respond with silence, as Hezekiah has ordered them. Sennacherib is briefly distracted by battling the Ethiopians that have launched an attack upon him, and so sends Hezekiah a letter reminding him that other nations' gods have not saved them from him. Apparently by way of preparation for any siege, Hezekiah constructs a conduit and pool providing water to Jerusalem. (Note:  This pool is not mentioned in the account of the siege in 2 Kings, but may be referenced in 2 Kings 20:20b and 2 Chronicles 32:3-5.)  Hezekiah sends messengers to Isaiah who prophecies that Yahweh will protect Jerusalem for the sake of the promise made to David, and the Assyrians will not be able to besiege Jerusalem. That night an angel kills one hundred eighty-five thousand men of the Assyrian army, and the survivors return to Assyria.  (There is an interesting interplay between this account and the Assyrian account which states that Hezekiah was ""locked up like a caged bird"", and paid tribute to Sennacherib--though the Assyrians put a good face on things, the desired end of a siege is usually to break into a city, not to keep the inhabitants pent up within it.) Fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy of divine retribution (or simply fulfilling the internal politics of Assyria), Sennacherib is killed by two of his own sons, and a third becomes king in his place.



The story of Hezekiah's shadow (2 Kings 20:1-20a, and 20:20c-21a): Isaiah visits Hezekiah on his deathbed to tell him to prepare for death, but when Hezekiah prays that his faithfulness will be remembered by Yahweh, Yahweh instructs Isaiah that 15 years have just been added to Hezekiah's life. Consequently, Isaiah gets a poultice to apply to Hezekiah's boil, and Hezekiah miraculously recovers. At Isaiah's instigation, Yahweh causes the shadow on Ahaz's sundial (early translations into English instead have Hezekiah's shadow on Ahaz's steps) to suddenly and noticeably extend backwards by an extra ten measures. Merodach-baladan, the son of the Babylonian king, sends get-well gifts to Hezekiah, and so, from politeness, Hezekiah shows the Merodach-baladan's messengers his treasures. Isaiah prophecies that having seen the treasure, Babylon's greed will cause them to invade and take it away, and deport the people at the same time.



The story of Manasseh (2 Kings 20:21b-21:23 and 21:25-26a) - Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, becomes the next king, and completely reverts Hezekiah's religious changes, which the writer blames for the later destruction of Judah by Babylon. The story of Manasseh is abridged at this point, though the Book of Chronicles records that Manasseh was taken prisoner by the Babylonians, and treated so badly that, when released, he was a reformed man. Many copies of the vulgate translation additionally record a Prayer of Manasseh which supposedly records Manasseh's repentance. After his death, his penitance is shown to be in vain when his son, Amon, perpetuates the rejection of Hezekiah's reform, and refuses to repent. However, Amon becomes the victim of a conspiracy when he is killed by his own servants. ;



The story of Josiah 2 Kings 21:24, and 21:26b-23:30a - A counter-conspiracy results in Josiah, son of Amon, being placed on the throne of Judah. During his godly reign, Josiah institutes repairs of the temple, during which the chief priest, Hilkiah, discovers a book of the law. This newly discovered book is verified as genuine by the prophetess Huldah, and the penitent Josiah vows to enact all the newly discovered mitzvah within it (most scholars, both critical and apologetic, view the book as an early version of deuteronomy, for which reason, Josiah's reform is often referred to as the deuteronomic reform). According to the narrative, no king before Josiah was ever as devout or fulfilled all of the torah, and Josiah is particularly zealous about his iconoclasm. Necho II leads an Egyptian army to join that of Assyria in attacking Babylon, and Josiah rides out and meets Necho at the Battle of Megiddo, but is killed.



The story of Jehoiakim (2 Kings 23:30b-24:6a and 24:7) - The people appoint Jehoahaz, a son of Josiah, as the king in place of Josiah, but Necho imprisons Jehoahaz, and deports him. Necho appoints another son of Josiah as the new king, who duly changes his name to Jehoiakim. Jehoiakim taxes the land to give tribute to Necho, but the land is soon attacked by Nebudchadnezzar, the Babylonian king. Easily defeated, Jehoiakim becomes the vassal of Babylon rather than Egypt, and the Babylonian empire reaches to the border of Egypt, so Egypt makes no further attempt to dominate the region. However, three years later, Jehoiakim rebels, and raiders from the surrounding nations are sent by Nebuchadnezzar to attack Judah. Though the account of Jehoiakim is somewhat abridged and goes no further in the Book of Kings, an account of his rebellion, Nebuchadnezzar's response, and Jehoiakim's violent death at the hands of his own people, is present in the Book of Jeremiah.



The story of Jeconiah (2 Kings 24:6b, 24:8-12, and 25:27-30) - Nebuchadnezzar appoints the son of Jehoiakim, namely Jeconiah, as the new king of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar attacks Jerusalem (for an unexplained reason) and besieges it, so Jehoniah and his court surrender and Jehoiachim is taken captive. Many decades later, Evil-merodach, a later king of Babylon, releases Jehoaichin from prison, give him an allowance, and generally treats him favourably, for the rest of his days.



The story of Zedekiah (2 Kings 24:17-25:7) - Nebuchadnezzar appoints the uncle of Jehoiachim as the new king of Judah, who duly changes his name to Zedekiah (Yahweh is Zedek / Yahweh is righteous). However, Zedekiah rebels, and so Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem and breaches the city walls. Although Zedekiah flees, he is captured and taken to Nebuchadnezzar, who has the sons of Zedekiah killed in front of him, and then has Zedekiah's eyes put out so that it is the last thing he has seen. Zedekiah is then bound in chains and taken to Babylon.



The story of the Babylonian captivity (2 Kings 24:13-16 and 25:8-21) - After Jehoiachim's surrender, Nebuchadnezzar deports everyone of any worth to Babylon, including the army, the people of Jerusalem, nobles, and craftsmen, as well as the treasures of Jerusalem. Once Zedekiah's later rebellion is suppressed, Nebudchadnezzar sends Nebuzaradan to Jerusalem, where he burns down the temple, palace, houses, and walls, and deports the treasures of the temple, and the population (excepting some of the poor), to Babylon. The two highest priests of the temple, a scribe, a courtiers, five personal servants to Zedekiah, and 60 people remaining in Jerusalem, are taken to Nebudchadnezzar and killed. ;



The story of Gedaliah (2 Kings 25:22-26) - The few people remaining in Judah are put under the command of Gedaliah, who promises the commanders of the army of Judah that they will not be harmed as long as they remain loyal to Babylon. However, one of the commanders, of royal descent, conspires against Gedaliah, and has him killed, but the people are so afraid of what Nebuchadnezzar's reaction might be, that almost the entire population of Judah flee to Egypt.



Authorship.

The authorship, or rather compilation, of these books is uncertain. The sources of the narrative are explicitly given as:

The ""book of the acts of Solomon"" (1 Kings 11:41);

The ""book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah"" (14:29; 15:7, 23, etc.);

The ""book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel"" (14:19; 15:31; 16:14, 20, 27, etc.).



The date of its composition was perhaps some time between 561 BC, the date of the last chapter (2 Kings 25), when Jehoiachin was released from captivity by Evil-merodach, and 538 BC, the date of the decree of deliverance by Cyrus the Great.



There are some portions that are almost identical to the Book of Jeremiah, for example, 2 Kings 24:18-25 and Jeremiah 52; 39:1-10; 40:7-41:10. There are also many undesigned coincidences between Jeremiah and Kings (2 Kings 21-23 and Jer. 7:15; 15:4; 19:3, etc.), and events recorded in Kings of which Jeremiah had personal knowledge.  Because of this, traditionally Jeremiah was credited the author of the books of Kings. 



However, the book(s) plainly acknowledge several source texts in several places, and it is hence self evidently a compilation from earlier sources rather than an original work. A superficial examination of the Books of Kings makes clear the fact that they are a compilation and not an original composition, and the compiler (usually referred to as the redactor)  constantly cites certain of his sources. In the case of Solomon it is the book of the acts of Solomon (1 Kings 11:41); for the Northern Kingdom it is the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel, which is cited seventeen times, that is,  for all the kings except Jehoram and Hoshea (e.g. 1 Kings 15:31); and for the kings of Judah it is the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah, which is cited fifteen times, that is,  for all the kings except Ahaziah, Athaliah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah (e.g. 1 Kings 15:7). As well as the text's own admission, the idea of the text being composed from multiple earlier sources is also supported by textual criticism. Whether the editor had access to these chronicles, as they were deposited in the state archives, or simply to a history based upon them, can not with certainty be determined, though it is generally assumed that the latter was the case. 



An early supposition was that Ezra, after the Babylonian captivity, compiled them from official court chronicles of David, Solomon, Nathan, Gad, and Iddo, and that he arranged them in the order in which they now exist. However, it is more usually said that Ezra was the compiler of the Books of Chronicles, an alternate history of the period of the kings, which was earlier in history treated as a single book together with the Book of Ezra and the Book of Nehemiah.



The majority of textual criticism is of the belief that, with the majority of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, and Samuel, these works were originally compiled into a single text, the Deuteronomic history, by a single redactor, the Deuteronomist. The similarities between the text of Deuteronomy and that of the Book of Jeremiah are so strong that many critical scholars view Jeremiah as the Deuteronomist, hence agreeing, in a round about sort of way, and for different reasons, with the traditional view concerning the authorship of Kings.



Object and method of work.



It was not the purpose of the compiler to give a complete history of the period covered by his work; for he constantly refers to these sources for additional details. He mentions as a rule a few important events which are sufficient to illustrate the attitude of the king toward the Deuteronomic law, or some feature of it, such as the central sanctuary and the high places, and then proceeds to pronounce judgment upon him accordingly. Each reign is introduced with a regular formula; then follows a short excerpt from one of his sources; after which an estimate of the character of the monarch is given in stereotyped phraseology; and the whole concludes with a statement of the king's death and burial, according to a regular formula (for example, compare 1 Kings 15:1-9 with 1 Kings 15:25-32).



The standpoint of the judgments passed upon the various kings as well as the vocabulary of the compiler indicates that he lived after the reforms of Josiah (621 B.C.) had brought the Deuteronomic law into prominence. How much later than this the book in its present form was composed, may be inferred from the fact that it concludes with a notice of Jehoiachin's release from prison by Evil-merodach (Amil-Marduk) after the death of Nebuchadnezzar in 562. The book must have taken its present form, therefore, during the Exile, and probably in Babylonia. As no mention is made of the hopes of return which are set forth in Isaiah 40-55, the work was probably concluded before 550. Besides the concluding chapters there are allusions in the body of the work which imply an exilic date (e.g. 1 Kings 8:34, 9:39; 2 Kings 17:19-20, 23:26-27). To these may be added the expression beyond the river (1 Kings 5:4), used to designate the country west of the Euphrates, which implies that Babylonia was the home of the writer.



Time of redaction.



On the other hand, there are indications which imply that the first redaction of Kings must have occurred before the downfall of the Judean monarchy. The phrase unto this day occurs in 1 Kings 8:8, 9:21, 12:19; 2 Kings 8:22, 16:6, where it seems to have been added by an editor who was condensing material from older annals, but described conditions still existing when he was writing. Again, in 1 Kings 9:36, 15:4, and 2 Kings 8:19, which come from the hand of a Deuteronomic editor, David has, and is to have, a lamp burning in Jerusalem; that is,  the Davidic dynasty is still reigning. Finally, 1 Kings 8:29-31, 8:33, 8:35, 8:38, 8:42, 8:44, 8:48, 9:3, 11:36 imply that the Temple is still standing. There was accordingly a pre-exilic Book of Kings. The work in this earlier form must have been composed between 621 and 586. As the glamour of Josiah's reforms was strong upon the compiler, perhaps he wrote before 600. To this original work 2 Kings 24:10-25:30 was added in the Exile, and, perhaps, 23:31-24:9. In addition to the supplement which the exilic editor appended, a comparison of the Masoretic text with the Septuagint as represented in codices B and L shows that the Hebrew text was retouched by another hand after the exemplars which underlie the Alexandrine text had been made. Thus in B and L, 1 Kings 5:7 follows on 4:19; 6:12-14 is omitted; 9:26 follows on 9:14, so that the account of Solomon's dealings with Hiram is continuous, most of the omitted portion being inserted after 10:22. 2 Kings 21, the history of Naboth, precedes ch. 20, so that 20 and 22, which are excerpts from the same source, come together. Such discrepancies prove sufficient late editorial work to justify the assumption of two recensions.



Sources.



In brief outline the sources of the books appear to have been these: 

1 Kings 1-2 are extracted bodily from the a source now known as the court history of David, which largely also constitutes 2 Samuel 9-20. The redactor has added notes at 1 Kings 2:2-4 and 2:10-12. ;

For the reign of Solomon the text names its source as the book of the acts of Solomon (11:41); but other sources were employed, and much was added by the redactor. ;

1 Kings 3 is a prophetic narrative of relatively early origin, worked over by the redactor, who added verses 2-3, and 14-15. ;

1 Kings 4:1-19 is presumably derived from the Chronicle of Solomon. ;

1 Kings 4:20-5:14, ""Solomon's Wealth and Wisdom"" (1 Ki 4:20-34 ESB), contains a small kernel of prophetic narrative which has been retouched by many hands, some of them later than the Septuagint. ;

The basis of 5:15-7:51 was apparently a document from the Temple archives; but this was freely expanded by the redactor, and 6:11-14 also by a later annotator. ;

1 Kings 8:1-13, the account of the dedication of the Temple, is from an old narrative, slightly expanded by later hands under the influence of the Priestly source of the Torah. ;

1 Kings 8:14-66 is in its present form the work of the redactor slightly retouched in the Exile. ;

1 Kings 9:1-9 is the work of the redactor, but whether before the Exile or during it is disputed. ;

1 Kings 9:10-10:29 consists of extracts from an old source, presumably the book of the acts of Solomon, pieced together and expanded by later editors. The order in the Masoretic text differs from that in the Septuagint. ;

1 Kings 11:1-13 is the work of the redactor; ;

1 Kings 11:14-22 is a confused account, perhaps based on two older narratives; ;

1 Kings 11:26-31 and 39-40 probably formed a part of a history of Jeroboam from which 12:1-20 and 14:1-18 were also taken. The extracts in chapter 11 have been set and retouched by later editors.



Narratives and epitomes.



From chapter 12 of 1 Kings onward, both 1&2 Kings are characterized by an alternation of short notices which give epitomes of historical events, with longer narratives extracted from various sources. The following sections are short epitomes: 

1 Kings 14:21-16:34;

1 Kings 22:41-53;

2 Kings 8:16-29;

2 Kings 10:32-36;

2 Kings 12:18-13:13;

2 Kings 13:22-17:6 ;

In some cases short extracts are even here made in full, as in 14:8-14 and 16:10-16.



The longer narratives, which are frequently retouched and expanded by the redactor, are as follows: 

1 Kings 12:1-20, 14:1-18, from an older narrative of Jeroboam, to which 12:21-32 and 14:19-20 are additions;

12:33-13:34, a comparatively late story of a prophet;

17:1-19:21 and 21:1-29, an early prophetic narrative written in the Northern Kingdom (c.f. 19:3);

20:1-43 and 22:1-40, an early north-Israelitish history of the Syrian war in which Ahab lost his life;

2 Kings 1:1-8:15 and 9:1-10:31, north-Israelitish narratives, not all from one hand, which are retouched here and there, as in 3:1-3, by the redactor;

11:1-12:17, a Judean narrative of the overthrow of Athaliah and the accession of Joash;

13:14-21 and 14:8-14, two excerpts from material written in the Northern Kingdom (c.f. 14:11);

17:7-23 is the redactor's commentary on the historical notice with which the chapter opens;

17:24-41 is composite (c.f. 17:32, 17:34, and 17:41), probably written in the Exile and retouched after the time of Nehemiah;

18:1-20:21 is compiled by the redactor from three sources, the redactor himself prefixing, inserting, and adding some material;

21:1-26 is, throughout, the work of the redactor;

22:1-23:25 is an extract from the Temple archives with slight editing;

23:29-25:30, the appendix of the exilic editor, is based on Jeremiah 40:7-53:6. From Jeremiah, too, the exilic editor drew his information, which he presented in briefer form.



Numbering.

The numbering of the Bible is usually considered to be fairly consistent throughout translations. However, most Hebrew versions, as well as the New American Bible, the official Roman Catholic translation, differ in the numbering of 1 Kings 4-5 from other translations such as the King James Version. One set of translations regards chapter 4 as ending at verse 20, while the other continues it for 14 verses that are placed at the start of chapter 5 in the first set. I.e.

1 Kings 5:1-14 in the first set is 1 Kings 4:21-34 in the second set;

1 Kings 5:15-32 in the first set is 1 Kings 5:1-18 in the second set;

1 Kings 4:21-34 does not exist in the first set, while 1 Kings 5:19-32 does not exist in the second set;



This article will follow the numbering of the Hebrew versions and the NAB, i.e. where 1 Kings 4:21-34 does not exist, and 1 Kings 5 has 32 verses.



Peculiar textual features.

Problems of dates.

The chronology of Kings has several problematic areas. The duration of reigns for the kings of Judah does not correspond correctly to their supposed times of accession compared to the reigns of the kings of Israel. Assigning the number of years after Solomon that each king of Judah reigned, by comparing the figure for their predecessor and the length of their predecessor's reign, simply does not equal the figure that you would obtain by comparing the figures for the kings of Israel and which year the king of Judah began to rule compared to the reign of the contemporary king of Israel. The same issue, transposed, obviously applies to the kings of Israel, and hence there are multiple different chronologies proposed for the period.



There are also external difficulties for the dating. The king that the Book of Kings names as Ahaz is claimed within it to reign for only 16 years. However, some of the events during his reign are recorded elsewhere, and have an almost absolute consensus as to their dates, requiring Ahaz to have at least ruled between 735BC and 715BC, a period of 20 years.



Problems of names.

The name Hadad and compounds of it occur at several locations within the text. Hadad is the name of the Canaanite deity that is often who the term Ba'al (which means lord) refers to. Consequently many kings from the region surrounding Israel and Judah would take throne names that were theophory in Hadad (or Ba'al), which has can lead to much confusion in the text, and some difficulty in identifying which people are the same individuals and which are different:

Hadadezer (Hadad+ezer) is an Assyrian king;

Hadad is the name of a king of Edom;

Ben-hadad is the name of one or more kings of Aram. Although this name simply means son of Hadad it does not necessarily mean that Hadad was the name of the king's father, but simply that the king was a king (i.e. a son of Hadad - the god);

King Hadad is the name of a god (according to the text), i.e. Hadad;



In addition, while Ba'al is usually used to refer to Hadad, the term Baalzebub also appears as the name of a deity. Ba'alzebub, meaning lord of the flies, is most likely to be a deliberate pun, by the anti-Hadad writer, on the term Ba'alzebul, meaning prince Ba'al, i.e. Hadad. Even more confusing is the fact that some passages refer to a single king of Assyria by two different names, whereas others refer simply to the king of Assyria in several places but are actually talking about 2 separate historically attested kings, not the same individual.



This problem is compounded in the names of Israelite and Judahite kings, where theophoric suffixes and prefixes exist in El and Yah/Yahweh, namely Ja...., Jeho..., ....iah, ...el, and El..... It was common to drop the theophory in ordinary day to day life, so that, for example, Daniel becomes simply Dan. In some cases double theophory occurred, as for example in the name of the king of Judah that contemporary cuneiform inscriptions record as Jeconiah (Je+Con+Iah), which the Book of Jeremiah drops one of the theophories to make the name simply Choniah (Chon+Iah), while the Book of Kings moves both theophories next to each other making his name Jehoiachin (Jeho+Iah+chon). Similarly theophory was often flexible as to which end of names it occurred at for a single individual, so that the king of Judah which the Book of Kings of names as Ahaziah (Ahaz + iah) is named by the Book of Chronicles as Jehoahaz (Jeho + ahaz) - ultimately this is the same name as had by the later king referred to as Ahaz.



Genealogical problems.





In the region of the Omrides (that is the descendants of Omri), there are remarkable co-incidences between the names of the kings of Judah and those of Israel, in that they are often identical; Jehoram was king of Israel while another Jehoram was king of Judah; Jehoash son of Jehoahaz was king of Israel while another Jehoash son of another Jehoahaz was king of Judah. As a consequence a number of scholars have proposed that this was a period in which Judah and Israel were united under one king, and by combining two different accounts of the same individual from the point of view of Israel and of Judah, the redactor of Kings has split one historic set of individuals into two copies. 



This feature is compounded by the fact that unlike the masoretic text, on which most English bible translations are based (at least for the old testament), the Septuagint version refers to Athaliah as daughter of Omri, rather than as daughter of the house of Omri. A number of scholars have suggested that the Septuagint represents the more original version, and hence that Athaliah was in reality either the sister, half-sister, or wife, of Ahab. Since her character and the manner of her death are described by the bible to be similar to Jezebel, the possibility that Jezebel is merely a descriptive slur or nickname for Athaliah has been raised. By equating the two, the genealogy can be simplified and a number of name duplications no longer occur. It is also possible that Athaliah was daughter of Jehoshaphat, and it was her marriage to Ahab that formed the Israel-Judah alliance, with the biblical form of the genealogy being later censorship to make Judah appear to have remained fairly religiously pure; this would explain how it was that she became queen over Judah, in contrast to how the bible portrays her as a biological daughter of the king of Israel.







The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser also refers to Jehu as son of Omri, rather than son of Jehoshaphat as the bible would prefer it, especially since the bible portrays Jehu as destroying the house of Omri rather than helping perpetuate it. By treating the Black Obelisk as historically accurate, and thus making Jehu a brother or half-brother to Ahab, it becomes much clearer why Jehu, who the bible portrays as a son of the king of Judah, would become the head of a dynasty of kings over Israel. Jehu would in this situation be the wicked uncle who killed the rightful kings of Israel and Judah, attempting to usurp power, but only managing to hold onto Israel, to which he had an ancestral claim.



Organization.



The two books of Kings comprise the fourth book in the second canonical division of Hebrew Scriptures: in the threefold division of the Tanach, these books are ranked among the Prophets. The present division into two books was first made by the Septuagint, which numbers them as the third and fourth books of ""Kingdoms"", the two books of Samuel being considered the first and second books of Kingdoms; this numbering was also followed in the Vulgate with 1-4 Kings, but most modern Christian Bibles have two books of Samuel and two of Kings.

33980,Waterfall model,"The waterfall model is a sequential software development model (a process for the creation of software) in which development is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing (validation), integration, and maintenance. The origin of the term ""waterfall"" is often cited to be an article published in 1970 by W. W. Royce; ironically, Royce himself  advocated an iterative approach to software development and did not even use the term ""waterfall"".  Royce originally described what is now known as the waterfall model as an example of a method that he argued ""is risky and invites failure"".



History of the waterfall model.



In 1970 Royce proposed what is now popularly referred to as the waterfall model as an initial concept, a model which he argued was flawed . His paper then explored how the initial model could be developed into an iterative model, with feedback from each phase influencing previous phases, similar to many methods used widely and highly regarded by many today. Ironically, it is only the initial model that received notice; his own criticism of this initial model has been largely ignored.  The ""waterfall model"" quickly came to refer not to Royce's final, iterative design, but rather to his purely sequentially ordered model.  This article will use this popular meaning of the phrase waterfall model.  For an iterative model similar to Royce's final vision, see the spiral model.



Despite Royce's intentions for the waterfall model to be modified into an iterative model, use of the ""waterfall model"" as a purely sequential process is still popular, and, for some, the phrase ""waterfall model"" has since come to refer to any approach to software creation which is seen as inflexible and non-iterative.  Those who use the phrase waterfall model pejoratively for non-iterative models that they dislike usually see the waterfall model itself as naive and unsuitable for a ""real world"" process.



Usage of the waterfall model.







In Royce's original waterfall model, the following phases are followed perfectly in order:



 Requirements specification;

 Design;

 Construction (aka: implementation or coding);

 Integration;

 Testing and debugging (aka: verification);

 Installation;

 Maintenance;



To follow the waterfall model, one proceeds from one phase to the next in a purely sequential manner.  For example, one first completes ""requirements specification""   they set in stone the requirements of the software.  (Example requirements for Wikipedia may be ""Wikipedia allows anonymous editing of articles; Wikipedia enables people to search for information"", although real requirements specifications will be much more complex and detailed.)  When and only when the requirements are fully completed, one proceeds to design.  The software in question is designed and a ""blueprint"" is drawn for implementers (coders) to follow   this design should be a plan for implementing the requirements given.  When and only when the design is fully completed, an implementation of that design is made by coders.  Towards the later stages of this implementation phase, disparate software components produced by different teams are integrated.  (For example, one team may have been working on the ""web page"" component of Wikipedia and another team may have been working on the ""server"" component of Wikipedia.  These components must be integrated together to produce the whole system.)  After the implementation and integration phases are complete, the software product is tested and debugged; any faults introduced in earlier phases are removed here.  Then the software product is installed, and later maintained to introduce new functionality and remove bugs.



Thus the waterfall model maintains that one should move to a phase only when its preceding phase is completed and perfected.  Phases of development in the waterfall model are thus discrete, and there is no jumping back and forth or overlap between them.



However, there are various modifed waterfall models (including Royce's final model) that may include slight or major variations upon this process.



Arguments for the waterfall model.



Time spent early on in software production can lead to greater economy later on in the software lifecycle; that is, it has been shown many times that a bug found in the early stages of the production lifecycle (such as requirements specification or design) is more economical (cheaper in terms of money, effort and time) to fix than the same bug found later on in the process. (1996, p. 72, estimates that ""a requirements defect that is left undetected until construction or maintenance will cost 50 to 200 times as much to fix as it would have cost to fix at requirements time."") This should be obvious to some people; if a program design is impossible to implement, it is easier to fix the design at the design stage than to realise months down the track when program components are being integrated that all the work done so far has to be scrapped because of a broken design.



This is the central idea behind Big Design Up Front (BDUF) and the waterfall model - time spent early on making sure that requirements and design are absolutely correct is very useful in economic terms (it will save you much time and effort later).  Thus, the thinking of those who follow the waterfall process goes, one should make sure that each phase is 100% complete and absolutely correct before proceeding to the next phase of program creation.  Program requirements should be set in stone before design is started (otherwise work put into a design based on ""incorrect"" requirements is wasted); the programs design should be perfect before people begin work on implementing the design (otherwise they are implementing the ""wrong"" design and their work is wasted), etcetera.



A further argument for the waterfall model is that it places emphasis on documentation (such as requirements documents and design documents) as well as source code.  More ""agile"" methodologies can de-emphasise documentation in favour of producing working code - documentation however can be useful as a ""partial deliverable"" should a project not run far enough to produce any substantial amounts of source code (allowing the project to be resumed at a later date).  An argument against agile development methods, and thus partly in favour of the waterfall model, is that in agile methods project knowledge is stored mentally by team members.  Should team members leave, this knowledge is lost, and substantial loss of project knowledge may be difficult for a project to recover from.  Should a fully working design document be present (as is the intent of Big Design Up Front and the waterfall model) new team members or even entirely new teams should theoretically be able to bring themselves ""up to speed"" by reading the documents themselves. With that said, agile methods do attempt to compensate for this. For example, extreme programming (XP) advises that project team members should be ""rotated"" through sections of work in order to familiarise all members with all sections of the project (allowing individual members to leave without carrying important knowledge with them).



As well as the above, some prefer the waterfall model for its simple and arguably more disciplined approach.  Rather than what the waterfall adherent sees as ""chaos"" the waterfall model provides a structured approach; the model itself progresses linearly through discrete, easily understandable and explainable ""phases"" and is thus easy to understand; it also provides easily markable ""milestones"" in the development process.  It is perhaps for this reason that the waterfall model is used as a beginning example of a development model in many software engineering texts and courses.



It is argued that the waterfall model and Big Design Up Front in general can be suited to software projects which are stable (especially those projects with unchanging requirements, such as with ""shrink wrap"" software) and where it is possible and likely that designers will be able to fully predict problem areas of the system and produce a correct design before implementation is started.  The waterfall model also requires that implementers follow the well made, complete design accurately, ensuring that the integration of the system proceeds smoothly.



The waterfall model is widely used, including by such large software development houses as those employed by the US Department of Defense and NASA (see ""the waterfall model"") and upon many large government projects (see ""the standard waterfall model"" on the Internet Archive). Those who use such methods do not always formally distinguish between the ""pure"" waterfall model and the various modified waterfall models, so it can be difficult to discern exactly which models are being used to what extent.



Steve McConnell sees the two big advantages of the pure waterfall model as producing a ""highly reliable system"" and one with a ""large growth envelope"", but rates it as poor on all other fronts. On the other hand, he views any of several modified waterfall models (described below) as preserving these advantages while also rating as ""fair to excellent"" on ""work with poorly understood requirements"" or ""poorly understood architecture"" and ""provid management with progress visibility"", and rating as ""fair"" on ""manag risks"", being able to ""be constrained to a predefined schedule"", ""allow for midcourse corrections"", and ""provid customer with progress visibility"". The only criterion on which he rates a modified waterfall as poor is that it requires sophistication from management and developers. (Rapid Development, 156)



 Criticism of the waterfall model .



The waterfall model however is argued by many to be a bad idea in practice, mainly because of their belief that it is impossible to get one phase of a software product's lifecycle ""perfected"" before moving on to the next phases and learning from them (or, at least, the belief that this is impossible for any non-trivial program).  For example, clients may not be aware of exactly what requirements they want before they see a working prototype and can comment upon it; they may change their requirements constantly, and program designers and implementers may have little control over this.  If clients change their requirements after a design is finished, that design must be modified to accommodate the new requirements, invalidating quite a good deal of effort if overly large amounts of time have been invested into ""Big Design Up Front"".  (Thus, methods opposed to the naive waterfall model--such as those used in Agile software development--advocate less reliance on a fixed, static requirements document or design document).  Designers may not (or, more likely, cannot) be aware of future implementation difficulties when writing a design for an unimplemented software product.  That is, it may become clear in the implementation phase that a particular area of program functionality is extraordinarily difficult to implement.  If this is the case, it is better to revise the design than to persist in using a design that was made based on faulty predictions and that does not account for the newly discovered problem areas.



Steve McConnell in Code Complete (a book which criticizes the widespread use of the waterfall model) refers to design as a ""wicked problem"" - a problem whose requirements and limitations cannot be entirely known before completion.  The implication is that it is impossible to get one phase of software development ""perfected"" before time is spent in ""reconnaissance"" working out exactly where and what the big problems are.



To quote from David Parnas' ""a rational design process and how to fake it (PDF)"":



 Many of the  details only become known to us as we progress in the  implementation.  Some of the things that we learn invalidate our design and we must backtrack. 



The idea behind the waterfall model may be ""measure twice; cut once"", and those opposed to the waterfall model argue that this idea tends to fall apart when the problem  being measured is constantly changing due to requirement modifications and new realizations about the problem itself.  The idea behind those who object to the waterfall model may be ""time spent in reconnaissance is seldom wasted"".



In summary, the criticisms of a non-iterative development approach (such as the waterfall model) are as follows:



 Many software projects must be open to change due to external factors; the majority of software is written as part of a contract with a client, and clients are notorious for changing their stated requirements.  Thus the software project must be adaptable, and spending considerable effort in design and implementation based on the idea that requirements will never change is neither adaptable nor realistic in these cases.

 Unless those who specify requirements and those who design the software system in question are highly competent, it is difficult to know exactly what is needed in each phase of the software process before some time is spent in the phase ""following"" it.  That is, feedback from following phases is needed to complete ""preceding"" phases satisfactorily.  For example, the design phase may need feedback from the implementation phase to identify problem design areas.  The counter-argument for the waterfall model is that experienced designers may have worked on similar systems before, and so may be able to accurately predict problem areas without time spent prototyping and implementing.

 Constant testing from the design, implementation and verification phases is required to validate the phases preceding them.  Constant ""prototype design"" work is needed to ensure that requirements are non-contradictory and possible to fulfill; constant implementation is needed to find problem areas and inform the design process; constant integration and verification of the implemented code is necessary to ensure that implementation remains on track.  The counter-argument for the waterfall model here is that constant implementation and testing to validate the design and requirements is only needed if the introduction of bugs is likely to be a problem.  Users of the waterfall model may argue that if designers (et cetera) follow a disciplined process and do not make mistakes that there is no need for constant work in subsequent phases to validate the preceding phases.

 Frequent incremental builds (following the ""release early, release often"" philosophy) are often needed to build confidence for a software production team and their client.

 It is difficult to estimate time and cost for each phase of the development process without doing some ""recon"" work in that phase, unless those estimating time and cost are highly experienced with the type of software product in question.

 The waterfall model brings no formal means of exercising management control over a project and planning control and risk management are not covered within the model itself.

 Only a certain number of team members will be qualified for each phase; thus to have ""code monkeys"" who are only useful for implementation work do nothing while designers ""perfect"" the design is a waste of resources.  A counter-argument to this is that ""multiskilled"" software engineers should be hired over ""specialized"" staff.



Modified waterfall models.



In response to the perceived problems with the ""pure"" waterfall model, many modified waterfall models have been introduced.  These models may address some or all of the criticisms of the ""pure"" waterfall model.  Many different models are covered by Steve McConnell in the ""lifecycle planning"" chapter of his book Rapid Development: Taming Wild Software Schedules.



While all software development models will bear at least some similarity to the waterfall model, as all software development models will incorporate at least some phases similar to those used within the waterfall model, this section will deal with those closest to the waterfall model.  For models which apply further differences to the waterfall model, or for radically different models seek general information on the software development process.



Royce's final model.

Royce's final model, his intended improvement upon his initial ""waterfall model"", illustrated that feedback could (should, and often would) lead from code testing to design (as testing of code uncovered flaws in the design) and from design back to requirements specification (as design problems may necessitate the removal of conflicting or otherwise unsatisfiable / undesignable requirements).  In the same paper Royce also advocated large quantities of documentation, doing the job ""twice if possible"" (a sentiment similar to that of Fred Brooks, famous for writing The Mythical Man Month, an influential book in software project management, who advocated planning to ""throw one away""), and involving the customer as much as possible now the basis of participatory design and of User Centred Design, a central tenet of Extreme Programming.



The ""sashimi"" model.

The sashimi model (so called because it features overlapping phases, like the overlapping fish of Japanese sashimi) was originated by Peter DeGrace.  It is sometimes simply referred to as the ""waterfall model with overlapping phases"" or ""the waterfall model with feedback"".  Since phases in the sashimi model overlap, information of problem spots can be acted upon during phases of the waterfall model that would typically ""precede"" others in the pure waterfall model.  For example, since the design and implementation phases will overlap in the sashimi model, implementation problems may be discovered during the ""design and implementation"" phase of the development process.  This helps alleviate many of the problems associated with the Big Design Up Front philosophy of the waterfall model.



Other alternative models.



The ""waterfall model with subprojects"" and the ""waterfall model with risk reduction"" are two other modified versions of the waterfall model.

In some ways the spiral model is comparable to the waterfall model; a ""waterfall model with iteration.""

17549,Forever Changes,"Forever Changes (1967) is the third album released by the Los Angeles-based quintet Love. 



History.

Dropping keyboardist Alban Pfisterer and flautist/saxophonist Tjay Cantrelli, the remaining five-piece performed on nine of the album's eleven tracks. The album was the first to be produced by Arthur Lee, with assistance from Bruce Botnick.  



Originally, the album was to be produced by Botnick and Neil Young, but Young bowed out due to his commitments to Buffalo Springfield.  However, according to the liner notes of the 1995 compliation ""Love Story"", Young did stick with the album project long enough to arrange the track ""The Daily Planet"".



The sessions began in June 1967, with the group (except for Lee and Maclean) replaced by well-known Los Angeles session musicians Billy Strange (guitar), Don Randi (piano), Hal Blaine (drums) and, in most likelihood, Carol Kaye (bass). This studio line-up was put in place due to the regular line-up's alleged inability to function. The two tracks laid down, ""Andmoreagain"" and ""The Daily Planet"", were later given sparing overdubs by the actual members of Love, who felt the tracks otherwise sufficed.



Botnick recalls that the use of session musicians ""sparked"" the band, and they ""realized they had blown it, got their act together and recorded the rest of the album"".  After much rehearsal, the group resumed work in August and continued through September, quickly laying down the remaining nine tracks, with a total estimated cost at $2,257. Rooted in acoustics, the album's lyrics were a perfect summation of the year 1967, at times joyous, at times contemplative, at times downright devastating.



""When I did that album,"" commented Arthur Lee, ""I thought I was going to die at that particular time, so those were my last words."" This is borne out by perhaps the most famous lines from the album, on the song ""The Red Telephone"":   



""Sitting on a hillside;

Watching all the people die;

I'll feel much better on the other side."" ;



A September recording session finished the album, sweetening the final mixes with horns and strings (arranged by David Angel with each song's respective songwriter), as well as some additional piano from Randi, who played all the keyboard parts on the album as the band now had no keyboard player. 



The album was released in November with cover art by Bob Pepper and disappeared, rising to a lowly #154 on the Billboard charts. It did however reach the Top 30 in Britain.  Only well after the group's break-up would the album be recognized as a masterpiece by the rock journalism press. It was re-released in an expanded version in 2001 on Rhino Records, featuring alternate mixes, outtakes and the group's 1968 single, ""Your Mind and We Belong Together""/""Laughing Stock"", the last tracks featuring Johnny Echols, Ken Forssi, Michael Stuart and, in most likelihood, Bryan MacLean. As for Arthur Lee, he would reform the group in late 1968 with all-new members and carry on the Love name for a few more years.  



In 1998 Q magazine readers voted Forever Changes the 82nd greatest album of all time. In Joe S. Harrington's Top 100 Albums it comes in at #69. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Forever Changes 40th in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in the December 11, 2003 issue. In a special issue of Mojo magazine, it was ranked the second greatest psychedelic album of all time. Forever Changes was ranked 83rd in a 2005 survey held by British television's Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.

1364160,A?r? Province,"For Mount A r  (A r  Da  ), see Mount Ararat.;

For the capital of the province, see A r .;





A r  (Armenian:        ; Kurdish: Agirî ) is a province on the eastern borders of Turkey, bordering Iran to the east, Kars to the North, Erzurum to the Northeast, Mu  and Bitlis to the Southeast, Van to the south, and I d r to the northeast. Area 11,376 km². Population 437,093 (1990). 



The provincial capital is A r , situated on a 1,650 m. high plateau.



Etymology.

See Mount Ararat (A r  Da  ).



In the Ottoman Empire era the area was called  orbulak, and Karakilise (black church) which was then mutated to Karaköse (the black man with no moustache!!!) towards the end of the Ottoman period. 



Districts.

A r  province is divided into 8 districts (capital district in bold):

A r ;

Diyadin;

Do ubeyaz t;

Ele kirt;

Hamur;

Patnos;

Ta l çay;

Tutak;





Geography.

A r  is named after the nearby majestic Mount Ararat, a 5,165 m. high stratovolcano, the highest mountain in Turkey. It can be climbed from here and can be seen from parts of Armenia, Iran, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The nearest town to the mountain is Do ubeyaz t.



46% of the province is mountain, 29% is plain, 18% is plateau, and 7% high meadow. As well as Ararat there are many other peaks over 3,000m, including Alada lar and Tendürek. The plains are fertile, being covered in volcanic deposits, and are used for growing grains and grazing. Various tributaries of the Murat River (which later feeds the Euphrates) flow through the area and water these plains. The high meadows are used for grazing. 



The weather here is very, very cold (temperatures as low as -45C in winter) and the mountainsides are mainly bare. There are a number of important passes and routes through the mountains. 



History.

The plateau of A r  was historically controlled by the Kingdom of Urartu until its transition to the Orontid Dynasty of the Kingdom of Armenia.  The area was coveted by many foreign invaders as a gateway between east and west.  It was conquered numerous times by Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Mongols, Persians, and finally by the Seljuq and Ottoman Turks.



The first Turkish presence in the region was the brief occupation of the Do ubeyaz t area by the Saka in 680. The first Muslims in the area were the Abbasids in 872. The Turkish hordes began to pass through in huge numbers following the defeat of the Byzantine armies at Malazgirt in 1071, sometimes pursued by Mongols. The land was brought into the Ottoman Empire by Sultan Selim II following the Battle of Chaldiran.



Under Ottoman rule, the area that is now the A r  Province mostly consisted of indigenous Armenians and Kurds.  The former lived fairly well until the Hamidian massacres and the Armenian Genocide.  Those Armenians who managed to escape liquidation fled north to Russian Armenia.



Since the establishment of the modern Turkish Republic, the area became unstable again with numerous Kurdish uprisings (one even leading to the temporary establishment of a Kurdish state, the Republic of Ararat).



Recent events.

On August 19, 2006, a Turkish-Iranian natural gas pipeline exploded in the province.  Turkish authorities suspect separatist PKK was behind the incident. 



A r  today.

People live by grazing animals and A r  also attracts tourists to the mountain, for climbing and trekking in summers, and skiing in winters; and also some are keen to see places of interest such as: 

Ishak Pasha Palace and the second-largest meteor crater in the world, in Do ubeyaz t;

Aznavur Tepe in Patnos;

The tomb of Ahmedi Hani in Diyadin.

2204223,Avobenzone,"Avobenzone (trade names Parsol® 1789, Eusolex® 9020, Escalol® 517 and others, INCI Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane) is an oil soluble ingredient used in sunscreen products to absorb both UVA and UVB rays.  Its ability to absorb ultraviolet light over a wider range of wavelengths than many organic sunscreen agents has led to its use in many commercial preparations marketed as ""broad spectrum"" sunscreens. According to doctors, ""the most effective sunscreens contain avobenzone and titanium dioxide.""  



Avobenzone has been shown to degrade significantly in light,    resulting in less protection over time. This degradation can be reduced by using a photostabilizer, like octocrylene. Other photostabilizers include:



 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (USAN Enzacamene);

 Tinosorb® S (USAN Bemotrizinol, INCI Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine);

 Tinosorb® M (USAN Bisoctrizole, INCI Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol);

 Butyloctyl Salicylate;

 Hexadecyl Benzoate;

 Butyloctyl Benzoate;

 Mexoryl® SX (USAN Ecamsule, INCI Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid)  ;

 Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate;

 Parsol® SLX (INCI Polysilicone-15);



Avobenzone shows to degrade faster in light in combination with mineral UV absorbers like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The FDA prohibits this combination. With the right coating of the mineral particles this reaction can be reduced. Avobenzone reacts with minerals to form colored complexes. Manufacturers of avobenzone, like DSM recommend to include a chelator to prevent this from happening. They also recommend to avoid the inclusion of iron and ferric salts, heavy metals, formaldehyde donors and PABA and PABA esters. 



The makers of Coppertone advise that avobenzone binds iron and can cause staining of clothes washed in iron-rich water.

1243627,Sean Conway,"Sean Conway (born July 24, 1951 in Pembroke, Ontario) was a long-serving politician in Ontario, Canada.  He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 2003, and was a high-profile cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson.



Conway attended St. Joseph's Separate School, Madawaska Valley District High School, and completed his education at Waterloo Lutheran University (now Wilfrid Laurier University) and Queen's University.  



In the provincial election of 1975, at age twenty-four, Conway was elected as a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the eastern Ontario riding of Renfrew North. His grandfather, Thomas Patrick Murray, had represented Renfrew South for the Liberals from 1929 to 1945.  He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Bob Cotnam by 183 votes.  The Progressive Conservatives won a minority government in the election, and Conway sat with his party in the opposition benches.



The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation in the 1977 election, although not by enough to form government; Conway was re-elected over Cotnam by an increased margin.  He became his party's official Critic for Health following the election, and served in this capacity for the entirety of the four-year minority parliament which followed.



The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the 1981 provincial election, although Conway was popular enough in his own riding to be re-elected by about 2,000 votes.  On March 9, 1982, he was chosen as Deputy Leader of Liberal Party by David Peterson, who had defeated Sheila Copps in a leadership convention the previous month.



The provincial election of 1985 resulted in a hung parliament, with the Progressive Conservatives having only four more seats than the Liberals and the New Democratic Party holding the balance of power with twenty-five seats.  Conway, by this time regarded as being on the progressive wing of his party, was involved in the Liberal Party's post-election negotiations with the NDP.  In this capacity, he helped bring about a written pact in which the NDP offered support to the Liberals for two years in return for certain progressive legislative initiatives.  On June 26, 1985 was named as the province's Minister of Education.



Conway's most controversial responsibility as Education Minister was managing the government's legislation for full funding to Ontario's Roman Catholic separate schools.  Conway's grandfather, Thomas Murray, had championed a similar initiative in the 1930s, and was disappointed when Mitchell Hepburn backed away from a previous commitment in the face of Protestant opposition.  Conway had supported the announcement of full funding by Bill Davis's Progressive Conservative government prior to the 1985 election, and was responsible for significantly increasing the actual revenues to the Catholic system after a mathematical error in the Davis government's funding formula came to light.  He also guaranteed hiring rights for non-Catholics within the system, and exempted non-Catholic children from compulsory religious education in separate high schools.  



For Conway, the issue of separate-school funding was a question of righting an historical wrong; others, however, regarded government funding of Catholic education as a threat to the public school system.  The larger issue of denominational school funding remains extremely controversial in the province.



On June 17, 1986, Conway was also named Acting Ontario Minister of Government Services, a position which he held until the dissolution of parliament in 1987.  He was re-elected by a landslide in the 1987 provincial election, in which the Liberals won 95 of 130 seats.  On September 29, 1987, he was named Government House Leader and Minister of Mines.  Following a cabinet shuffle on August 2, 1989, he was again named Minister of Education, and also held the portfolios of Minister of Skills Development and Colleges and Universities.



Like many others in the Peterson government, Conway opposed holding an early election in 1990 (in fact, he would later reveal that sentiment in the party caucus was almost uniformly against an early trip to the polls).  Nonetheless, Peterson called a snap provincial election in 1990, and his party was resoundingly defeated by the NDP.  Conway himself was re-elected in a landslide in Renfrew North, where the NDP has a very limited base of historical support.  On September 17, 1991, he was chosen as Deputy Leader of the Official Opposition. Conway did not contest the Liberal leadership in 1992.



The Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris returned to government in the 1995 provincial election with a large majority. Despite the Tories' sweep of much of the province, Conway's personal popularity allowed him a fairly easily re-election in Renfrew North.



Conway was the early frontrunner to succeed Lyn McLeod as party leader in 1996, and surprised many by choosing not to run. Conway instead supporting Dwight Duncan, who finished fourth.  He continued to serve as Deputy Opposition Leader until December 19, 1996, when new party leader Dalton McGuinty replaced him with Joseph Cordiano.  In the 1999 election, he defeated an incumbent MPP, Tory Leo Jordan, in the redistributed riding of Renfrew--Nipissing--Pembroke.  With the retirement of Bud Wildman in 1999, Conway became the longest-serving member of the legislature.  



Having spent more than half his life as an MPP, Conway decided to retire before the 2003 provincial election.  He is currently a member of TV Ontario's political discussion panel, a public policy advisor with Gowlings Professionals, and a Visiting Fellow at the Queen's University School of Policy Studies."
1273043,American Tune,"""American Tune"" is a song written and first performed by Paul Simon. The song first appeared on Simon's second solo album following the breakup of Simon and Garfunkel, There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973). It was also released as a single, Columbia 45900, backed with ""One Man's Ceiling Is Another Man's Floor,"" which Simon released on the same album.



Lyrically, the song at the surface is an evocation of weariness and confusion, as the narrator describes being far from home and ""wonder what's gone wrong."" Metaphorically, the song may be addressing the perceived decline of American society as the lyrics include a dream image of the Statue of Liberty ""sailing away to sea"" and rueful mentions of the Mayflower and the Apollo program, before concluding ""it's all right/You can't be forever blessed/Still tomorrow's going to be another working day/And I'm trying to get some rest.""



Musically, the song is notable for being based on a melody line from Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale from ""St. Matthew Passion,"" itself a reworking of an earlier secular song, ""Mein Gmüth ist mir verwirret,"" composed by Hans Hassler.



Eventually it became a concert favorite, both for Simon and in reunion concerts with Simon's former singing partner Art Garfunkel (who has stated in concert that he wished that he and Simon had recorded this song before they split in 1970). The duo has claimed that had they not split, the song would have become another massive hit, similar to what ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" had been. The song appears on several of Simon's solo live albums and on Simon and Garfunkel's post-breakup live albums, as well as many Simon compilation albums. The song has also been covered by many artists, notably Willie Nelson and Eva Cassidy.



The song was also featured on at least one episode of the NBC television series Providence."

8931454,Theodore Case,"Theodore Willard Case (1888 Auburn, New York   1944) began working on his sound-on-film process in 1916. From 1922 to 1924, Case joined forces with Lee De Forest, working to integrate his system with De Forest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process, which had been patented by DeForest in 1919. 



On 15 April 1923, DeForest presented 18 short films made in the Phonofilm process at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. The printed program for this presentation gives credit to the ""DeForest-Case Patents"". However, Case and DeForest had a falling out, shortly after DeForest filed a lawsuit against Freeman Harrison Owens, another inventor who had worked with DeForest on sound-on-film systems. 



From 1926 to 1927, Case worked with Earl I. Sponable and movie mogul William Fox to develop the Fox Movietone process. Fox had previously purchased the rights to the sound film patents of Owens -- who had developed a sound movie camera as early as 1921 and coined the term ""Movietone"" -- and the U.S. rights to the German Tri-Ergon sound-on-film process.



Titles filmed by Case in his process, all made at the Case Studios in Auburn, New York, include Miss Manila Martin and Her Pet Squirrel (1921), Gus Visser and His Singing Duck (1925), Bird in a Cage (1923), Gallagher and Shean (1925), Madame Fifi (1925), and Chinese Variety Performer with a Ukelele (1925).

726926,Black-billed Whistling Duck,"The Black-billed Whistling Duck, Dendrocygna arborea, is a whistling duck which breeds in the West Indies. Alternative names are West Indian Whistling Duck and Cuban Whistling Duck.



The Black-billed Whistling Duck is widely scattered throughout the West Indies including a large breeding population in the Bahamas, and smaller numbers in Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Antigua and Barbuda, and Jamaica. It is largely sedentary, apart from local movements which can be 100 km or more. Nests have been reported in tree cavities, on branches, in clumps of bromeliads, and on the ground under thatch palms and other dense bushes. The usual clutch size is 10-16 eggs. It habitually perches in trees, which gives rise to its specific name. 



The birds are mostly nocturnal and secretive, inhabiting wooded swamps and mangroves, where this duck roosts and feeds on plant food including the fruit of the Royal Palm.



The Black-billed Whistling Duck is the largest (48-58 cm) and darkest of its genus. It has a long black bill, long head and longish legs. It has a pale foreneck and light brown face. The crown, back, breast and wings are dark brown to black, and the rest of the underparts are white with heavy black markings.



All plumages are similar, except that juveniles are duller and have a less contrasted belly pattern.



 Threats .

The Black-billed Whistling Duck has suffered extensive hunting for its eggs and for sport. Wetlands are a very limited habitat in the Caribbean, with continuing conversion for development and agriculture. More than 50% of remaining wetlands are seriously degraded by the cutting of mangroves and swamp-forest, pollution (especially over-use of pesticides1) and natural catastrophes such as droughts and hurricanes. Predation is inadequately documented but may be a factor.



 Current conservation measures .

CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. It is legally protected throughout much of its range, but law enforcement is inadequate.  N. L. Staus (1997)  The West Indian Whistling Duck Working Group initiated a conservation programme in 1997. L. G. Sorenson (1997) There are several protected areas in the region but, in general, suitable habitat, especially wetlands, is under-represented. N. L. Staus (1997)



 Proposed conservation measures .

Conduct extensive surveys to assess numbers and distribution; assist local authorities in establishing a long-term monitoring programme; conserve key sites; enforce legal protection; initiate public education and awareness programmes. Staus (1997)

64673,Bruce Willis,"Bruce Willis (born Walter Bruce Willis on March 19, 1955) is an American actor and singer. He came to fame in the late 1980s and has since retained a career as both a Hollywood leading man and a supporting actor.



Biography.

Early life.

Willis was born in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany to an American father, David Willis, and a Kassel-born German mother, Marlene, who worked in a bank. After being discharged from the military in 1957, Willis's father took his family back to Penns Grove, New Jersey, and he worked as a welder and factory worker. Willis was the oldest of four children. He was always an outgoing youngster, although he grew up with a stutter. Finding it easy to express himself on stage, Willis began performing on stage and his high school memberships were marked by such things as the drama club and school council president.



Rather than go to college after graduation, Willis farmed sheep in a mining village in Alabama, transporting work crews at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater, New Jersey. He decided to quit after a colleague was killed on the job, and thereafter became a regular at several bars. Willis also discovered an innate knack for playing harmonica, and did so for an R&B group, Loose Goose. After a stint as a bodyguard (which he actually plays in his 1991 movie, The Last Boy Scout), Willis returned to his original passion of acting. He enrolled in the drama program at Montclair State College, where he was cast as Brick in the class production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof with Jack Prince as Big Daddy, William Applegate as the doctor and Kevin J. Lynch as the Rev. Tooker. The ambitious junior finally decided to leave school in pursuit of more lucrative movie roles by heading for New York City. 



Willis returned to the bar scene, only this time for a part-time job and as a way to meet New York celebrities. He is rumored to have been 'discovered' while working at the Museum Cafe on New York's Upper West Side. After countless auditions, Willis finally made his theater debut in the off-Broadway production of Heaven and Earth. He gained more experience and exposure in Fool for Love, a stint on television's Miami Vice, and a Levi's campaign.



Career.

Willis first found fame with his starring role in the hit TV series Moonlighting (1985 89) establishing himself as a comedic actor. However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the Die Hard series that catapulted him to fame. He also was successful in his turn as the voice of little Mikey in the Look Who's Talking series.



In the late-1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a recording artist, recording an album of pop-blues entitled The Return of Bruno, which included the hit single ""Respect Yourself"", promoted by a Spinal Tap-like rockumentary parody featuring scenes of him performing at famous events including Woodstock.  Follow-up recordings were not as successful, though Willis does return to the recording studio from time to time.



In the early 1990s, Willis' career suffered a moderate slump starring in flops such as The Bonfire of the Vanities and Hudson Hawk, among others. However, in 1994 he had a supporting role in Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed Pulp Fiction, which gave a new boost to his career. In 1996, he produced the cartoon Bruno the Kid which featured a CGI representation of himself. He went on to play the lead roles in Twelve Monkeys and The Fifth Element. However, by the end of the '90s, his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like The Jackal, Mercury Rising and Breakfast of Champions, saved only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed Armageddon which was the highest grossing film of 1998 in the US.



In 1999, Willis achieved what could be considered the biggest success of his career with his starring role in M. Night Shyamalan's film, The Sixth Sense. The film was both a commercial and critical success and launched Willis' career to a new level of stardom.

He once had to appear in the hit sitcom Friends without pay, because he lost a bet to Matthew Perry, his co-star in The Whole Nine Yards and its sequel The Whole Ten Yards. He won a 2000 Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on Friends (in which he played the father of Ross Geller's much-younger girlfriend). He was also nominated for a 2001 American Comedy Award (in the Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series category) for his work on Friends. Willis was originally cast as Terry Benedict in Ocean's Eleven (2001) but dropped out. In Ocean's Twelve (2003), he makes a cameo appearance as himself.



Willis also appeared on Japanese Subaru Legacy television commercials, optimising the car for sale, with the backing music of Jade from Sweetbox, ""Addicted"" and ""Hate Without Frontiers"". Tying in with this, Subaru did a limited run of Legacys, badged ""Subaru Legacy Touring Bruce"", in honor of Willis.



Willis has appeared in four movies with Samuel L. Jackson (Unbreakable, Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, and National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1). He is also currently working on the film Black Water Transit alongside Jackson due in 2007.



He has finished filming the thriller Perfect Stranger, opposite Halle Berry, and will appear as a corrupt farmer in the film version of Fast Food Nation. He is now filming his return to the role of John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard which is being directed by Len Wiseman.

On October 16, 2006, Willis was honored with a star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is located at 6915 Hollywood Boulevard and it is the 2321st Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.



Personal life.

Willis was married to actress Demi Moore from November 21, 1987 to October 18, 2000. The couple gave no public reason for their breakup.  Willis and Moore had three daughters during their thirteen-year union: Rumer Glenn Willis (born 1988), Scout LaRue Willis (1991) and Tallulah Belle Willis (1994). Since their breakup, rumors persisted that the couple planned to re-marry, but Moore has since married Ashton Kutcher. He and Moore have maintained a close relationship.



Bruce was, at one point, Lutheran (specifically Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod); however, he is believed by some to now be an atheist or an agnostic. This is mostly because of a statement he made in the July 1998 issue of George magazine:



""Organized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms"", he says. ""They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened"", he continues. ""Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally!"" he says incredulously. ""I choose not to believe that's the way. And that's what makes America cool, you know?"";



Some reports from military officials suggest that Willis tried to enlist in the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but he was turned away because of his age. He has offered $1 million to any civilian who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri or (now the late) Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.



Willis has said that he wants to ""make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy"". The film will follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former United States Army Special Forces Green Beret who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their heroics.



Willis was one of few Hollywood celebrities to publicly support the Iraq War in 2003. He has endorsed every Republican presidential candidate except Bob Dole in 1996, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the movie Striptease.  Willis has attempted to play down his status as one of Hollywood's most outspoken Republicans, although he continues to vocally support the Iraq war and gun ownership. In February 2006, Willis appeared in Manhattan to talk about his new movie 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on current events but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence:



I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of... every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican... I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican.;



In a July 2006 interview with Alex Jones, film director Richard Linklater -- who believes that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were perpetrated by the United States government to erect a police state -- said he gave one of Jones's documentaries to Willis. Linklater said Willis had told him in an e-mail that the video had changed his entire political paradigm. ""He said it put him in such a head space that he will be quiet on issues of national policy,"" Linklater said. However, Michael Yon, a close friend of Willis confirmed that this was not true. After contacting him about the issue, Yon claimed:



Bruce got back to me this morning saying the press has misconstrued his statements and that this is untrue. Bruce said in part,   the Linklater statements have been completely misconstrued, as usual by the media.  It s clear that some media are just attaching Bruce s name to gain traction. I will not talk about private communications so will keep this very brief by saying I know Bruce s support for the troops is ongoing and, if anything, increasing. Bruce does not believe this conspiracy theory.;



In early 2006, Willis, who usually lives in Los Angeles, moved into an apartment located in the Trump Tower in New York City. Willis also has a home in Malibu, CA, a ranch in Montana and multiple properties in Sun Valley, Idaho.



He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when he was supposed to be a guest. He interviewed Dan Rather in what he would later call ""the most serious conversation of my entire life"". On many of his appearances on the Letterman show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, or having one side of his face made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting. Also on The Late Show with David Letterman, Willis was seen trying to break the holding your breath under water record (parody of David Blaine) staying under for only 20 seconds.



Willis signed his name on an ad in the Los Angeles Times in support of Israel, along with Nicole Kidman and numerous other Hollywood elites. In 2006, he proposed that the United States should invade Colombia in order to end the drug trafficking.



Willis owns his own motion picture production company called Cheyenne Enterprises, as well as The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater in Hailey, Idaho. He is also a co-founder of Planet Hollywood.

2147568,John O. Pastore,"John Orlando Pastore (1907-2000) was a Rhode Island Democratic Party politician who was a United States Senator from Rhode Island (1950 until 1976) and the Governor of Rhode Island (1945 until 1950), and was the first Italian American to hold either position.



Born in Providence on March 17 1907, he graduated from law school at Northeastern University in 1931 and practiced law in Providence. He was a member to the State House of Representatives from 1935 to 1937, was assistant attorney general of Rhode Island from 1937 to 1938 and again from 1940 to 1944, and was eventually elected Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island in 1944. In 1946 he was elected Governor of Rhode Island, and re-elected in 1948.



In 1950 he was elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat in a special election to replace J. Howard McGrath, who had resigned. He was re-elected in 1952, 1958, 1964 and 1970. 



In the summer of 1964, he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which renominated Lyndon B. Johnson for the Presidency. 



He won his final Senate race in 1970 by a 68%-32% margin over John McLaughlin, a Catholic Priest who was against the Vietnam war.  After the campaign, McLaughlin left the priesthood, went to work for Richard Nixon at the White House, and later became a nationally-known television commentator.





In 1976 he retired, living in Cranston until his death due to kidney failure on July 15, 2000.



Pastore served as the chairman of United States Senate Subcommittee on Communications. He is remembered for taking part in a 1969 hearing involving Fred Rogers regarding the funding of PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. President Richard Nixon had wanted to cut the proposed funding to from $20 million to $10 million, and Rogers appeared before the committee to argue for the full $20 million.  In about five minutes of testimony, Rogers spoke of the need for social and emotional education that public television provided. Pastore was not previously familiar with Rogers' work, and was sometimes described as gruff and impatient. However, he told Rogers that the testimony had given him goose bumps, and declared, ""Looks like you just earned the $20 million."" The following congressional appropriation, for 1971, increased PBS funding from $9 million to $22 million."
238846,D.O.A. (1950 film),"D.O.A. is a 1950 movie considered a classic of the film noir genre. The frantically-paced plot revolves around a doomed man's quest to find out who has murdered him   and why   before he dies.



Some trace the film's plot to  Der Mann der Seinen Mörder Sucht (Looking for His Murderer), a 1931 German film by Robert Siodmak.   The film was remade in 1969 (as the British Color Me Dead) and again in 1988 with Dennis Quaid as the protagonist.



Due to copyright law issues, it has fallen into the public domain.

Neville Brand  Chester;



Plot.



The film begins with a scene called ""perhaps one of cinema's most innovative opening sequences"" by a BBC reviewer.  The scene is a long, behind-the-back tracking sequence featuring Frank Bigelow (O'Brien) walking through a hallway into a police station to report a murder: his own.  Disconcertingly, the police almost seem to have been expecting him and already know who he is.



The flashback that follows begins with Bigelow's deciding to take off from his hometown of Banning, California, where he is an accountant and notary public, for a one-week week in San Francisco. This does no sit well with  Paula (Britton), his ""confidential secretary"" and love interest.  



After crossing paths at his hotel with a group from a sales convention, Bigelow accompanies them on a night on the town.  He ends up at a jazz club, where unknown to him, a man wearing an overcoat and hat swaps his drink for another.  



By the next morning, Bigelow is feeling ill. He visits a doctor, where tests are performed and he is told he has swallowed a ""luminous toxin"" for which there is no antidote. (Its luminosity and references to iridium imply a form of radiation poisoning).





With only a short time to live, Bigelow sets out to try to untangle the events behind his imminent demise, interrupted occasionally by phone calls from Paula.  The murder involves gangsters and shady character, but the key to the mystery is a bill of sale for stolen iridium, which Bigelow himself had unwittingly notarized.



Bigelow tracks down and finds the person who had poisoned him, and shoots him to death in an exchange of gunfire. The flashback comes to an end, and Bigelow, now at the police station, dies. The police detective taking  down the report instructs that his file be marked ""DOA,"" or ""dead on arrival."" 







Critical response.

The New York Times, in its May 1950 review, described it as a ""fairly obvious and plodding recital, involving crime, passion, stolen iridium, gangland beatings and one man's innocent bewilderment upon being caught up in a web of circumstance that marks him for death""; O'Brien's performance was said to have had a ""good deal of drive"", while Britton added a ""pleasant touch of blonde attractiveness"".  



25 years later, the same paper published a brief review of the film written by Wallace Markfield, characterizing it as one of a number of the ""very best of the B's ... made on workhouse budgets under coolie conditions"" with a power ""derived from the central image of one chunky, sweating, absolutely desolated human and from the way it puts the spectator inside that human's skin and nerves"".



In a 1981 book, Foster Hirsch continued a trend of more positive reviews, calling Bigelow's search for his own killer noir irony at its blackest:  

""One of the films many ironies is that his last desperate search involves him in his life more forcefully than he has ever been before.  The as is so. Tracking down his killer just before he dies   discovering the reason for his death   turns out to be the triumph of his life"".



A 2000 Salon.com review at the time of a DVD release of the film characterized it as a ""high-concept movie before its time"".



Perhaps the strongest endorsement came from the Library of Congress, which in 2004 added the film to its National Film Registry.



Trivia.

 The nightclub in this movie includes one of the earliest depictions of the Beat scene.

Liquid Television's Stick Figure Theater did a version of a scene.

3119065,John Devine,"John Anthony Devine (born November 11 1958 in Dublin) is an Irish former footballer.



Born in Dublin, Devine joined London club Arsenal in November 1974 as an apprentice. Part of a large young Irish contingent at Arsenal (which also included Liam Brady, David O'Leary and Frank Stapleton), Devine turned professional in 1976. A full back who preferred playing on the right, he made his debut for the Gunners on April 28, 1978, deputising for Pat Rice.



With Rice and Sammy Nelson occupying the Arsenal full back positions most of the time, Devine didn't break into the first team straight away, although he did play in the 1980 FA Cup final (which Arsenal lost 1-0 to West Ham United) after Rice was injured. However, Rice returned to the Arsenal side for the Gunners' Cup Winners Cup final against Valencia, which Devine missed. After Rice left for Watford in the summer of 1980, Devine stepped up to become Arsenal's regular right-back, playing 44 times in 1980-81. However, his tenure there didn't last; after Devine was out of the side with injury, John Hollins was moved back into defence as cover, and Devine could not reclaim his place once he had regained fitness. He played only 23 games in his final two seasons at Arsenal.



Devine was capped for the Republic of Ireland at ever level, winning thirty caps in all, with thirteen of those coming for the senior side. He made his senior debut on September 26, 1979 against Czechoslovakia, and his last cap came against Norway on October 17, 1984. He never played in a World Cup or European Championship finals, as Ireland did not qualify for any tournaments during that time, although most of his caps were won in European and World cup Qualifying games.



Devine left Arsenal in the summer of 1983, having played 111 first-team matches for the club in nine years. He joined Norwich City, and played 69 games in two seasons for the Canaries, and was an unused sub in the Canaries' League Cup final win in 1984-85. He then had a stint at Stoke City, but after breaking his leg his career was effectively over. He had brief spells at Norwegian club I.K. Start, before signing for Shamrock Rovers in 1989. He helped Rovers to the FAI Cup final in 1991 before signing for Indian side East Bengals



He then became a coach at Shelbourne. Shelbourne's close ties with Manchester United led to Devine working with the English club, and he has been United's head of youth development in Ireland since 1997.

978991,Stamp Act,"A stamp act is a law enacted by a government that requires a tax to be paid on the transfer of certain documents such as property deeds. Those that pay the tax receive an official stamp on their documents. The tax raised, called stamp duty, was first devised in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax. A variety of products have been covered by stamp acts including playing cards, patent medicines, cheques, mortgages, contracts and newspapers. The items often have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty although methods involving annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common.



Stamp acts were inforced in many countries including Australia, People's Republic of China, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.



Stamp acts in Britain and America.

Stamp duties are the oldest taxes still raised by the Inland Revenue. 



 Stamp acts that were an issue while colonizing America 

1689 Stamp Act

Stamp Duty was first introduced in England in 1694 following the Dutch model as An act for granting to Their Majesties several duties on Vellum, Parchment and Paper for 4 years, towards carrying on the war against France.



The duty ranged between 1 penny to shillings on a number of different legal documents including insurance policies, documents used as evidence in courts, grants of honour, grants of probate and letters of administration. It raised around £50,000 a year and altM

n enjoyed a free press with satirical and seditious publications becoming more and more widely read. As well as raising money the act was an attempt to limit the readership of such publications without invoking explicit censorship.



1724 Stamp Act In 1724 the Act was renewed, although vigorously resisted, its tax on publications was eventually enforced. In 1743 selling unstamped newspapers was made a criminal offence.





1765 Stamp Act This is the main Stamp Act of 1765

In 1765 ,List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom Prime Minister George Grenville proposed, and Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentn passed, a Stamp Act to be enacted in the American colonies . It placed a tax on legal documents such as contracts, licenses and wills, and on newspapers, playing cards and dice. Colonial leaders protested that such a tax was ""internal,"" or intended to regulate behavior entirely within the colonies, as opposed to the Navigation Laws taxes on imported good ,which were ""external"" and therefore acceptable. They protested also that the goal of the tax was explicitly to raise revenue, whereas the Navigation laws were intended to maintain the system of mercantalism by which the Empire managed its economy.



 Post-American Revolution Stamp Acts 



1777 Stamp Act

Introduced by William Pitt the Younger who described Stamp Duty as a tax easily raised, pressing little on any particular class, especially the lower orders of society, and producing a revenue safely and expeditiously collected at small expense. He pointed out that there had been no significant increases in Stamp Duty for some time and so practically doubled the tax. It taxed all paper products.



1808 Stamp Act

Stamp Duty was first imposed on conveyances on sale. Duties in England and Scotland were equalized for the first time.



1815 Stamp Act

Ad valorem duty was extended to more documents. Newspaper stamp duty was increased to sixpence a page making papers unobtainable to all but the rich. That year the tax raised £3,250,000.

Some publishers such as Richard Carlile defied the law and continued to publish their newspapers without charging the extra tax. Carlile was tried on charges of blasphemy and seditious libel in an attempt to close down his paper, The Republican. He was found guilty, sentenced to three years in Dorchester Jail and fined £1,500. 



The poet William Wordsworth worked as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland from this time until his death. Little is known of his official activities, but it seems from a government report that he was in charge of a large area and was prompt in the performance of his duties.



In the 1830s men such as Henry Hetherington, James Watson, John Cleave, George Julian Harney and James O'Brien US Congressman James O'Brien joined Richard Carlile in fighting against what they called a 'tax on knowledge'. The men were often persecuted, being arrested and punished for contravention of the Act. Sales of unstamped newspapers were vastly higher than legal news sources such as The Times.



1855 Stamp Act.

The tax on newspapers was finally abolished following pressure from the publishers' lobbying group, the Newspaper Stamp Abolition Committee led by Henry Hetherington.



1891 Stamp Act and Stamp Duties Management Act.

All the above Acts were superseded by the Stamp Duties Management Act 1891 and the Stamp Act 1891 which still constitute the bulk of UK law on Stamp Duties today.



The modern UK Stamp Act.

In 1914 The Director of Stamping at the Stamp Office oversaw the production of the first Treasury Notes (later called banknotes, not to be confused with US Treasury notes). This lasted until 1928 when production of banknotes passed from the Department to the Bank of England. In 1963 production of postage stamps passed to the Post Office.



The Finance Act 1986 introduced Stamp Duty Reserve Tax. From 27 October 1986 the charge was imposed on 'closing' transactions at the London Stock Exchange which until then had been transactions where no document was used and therefore exempt from Stamp Duty.



A public display of Stamp Office artefacts and records was held at the Courtauld Institute in 1994 to commemorate the Three hundredth anniversary of the introduction of UK Stamp Duty. The Stamp Office was also awarded the Charter Mark by John Major's Advisory Committee as a reward for its public service."

8299869,Alice Stewart,"Dr Alice Mary Stewart (née Naish) (4 October 1906, Sheffield, England to 23 June 2002, Oxford, England) was a physician and epidemiologist specialising in social medicine and the effects of radiation on health. 



Her pioneering study of x-rays as a cause of childhood cancer (1953) was initially regarded as unsound, but her findings were eventually accepted worldwide and the use of medical x-rays during pregnancy and early childhood was curtailed as a result. 



Her most famous investigation (working with Professor Thomas Mancuso of the University of Pittsburgh) was among employees in the Hanford plutonium production plant, Washington, which found a far higher incidence of radiation-induced ill health than was noted in official studies. Sir Richard Doll, the epidemiologist respected for his work on smoking-related illnesses, attributed her anomalous findings to a ""questionable"" statistical analysis supplied by her assistant, George Kneale, but today her account is valued as a response to the perceived bias in reports produced by the nuclear industry.



In 1986 she was added to the roll of honour of the Right Livelihood Foundation, an annual award supported by the Swedish Parliament.

1043012,Uveitis,"Uveitis specifically refers to inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, termed the ""uvea"" but in common usage may refer to any inflammatory process involving the interior of the eye.



Uveitis is estimated to be responsible for approximately 10% of the blindness in the United States. Uveitis requires an urgent referal and thorough examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist, along with urgent treatment to control the inflammation.



Types.

Uveitis is usually categorized anatomically into anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitic forms.



 Anywhere from two-thirds to 90% of uveitis cases are anterior in location (anterior uveitis), frequently termed iritis - or inflammation of the iris and anterior chamber. This condition can occur as a single episode and subside with proper treatment or may take on a recurrent or chronic nature. Symptoms include red eye, injected conjunctiva, pain and decreased vision. Signs include dilated ciliary vessels, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates (""KP"") on the posterior surface of the cornea. ;

 Intermediate uveitis consists of vitritis - inflammatory cells in the vitreous cavity, sometimes with snowbanking, or deposition of inflammatory material on the pars plana.

 Posterior uveitis is the inflammation of the retina and choroid. ;

 Pan-uveitis is the inflammation of all the layers of the uvea.



Causes.

A myriad of conditions can lead to the development of uveitis, including systemic diseases as well as syndromes confined to the eye. In anterior uveitis, no specific diagnosis is made in approximately one-half of cases. However, anterior uveitis is often one of the syndromes associated with HLA-B27.

Masquerade syndromes.

Masquerade syndromes are ophthalmic disorders that clinically present as either an anterior or posterior uveitis, but are not primarily inflammatory. The following are some of the most common:

Anterior segment;

Intraocular foreign body;

Juvenile xanthogranuloma;

Leukemia;

Malignant melanoma;

Retinoblastoma;

Retinal detachment;

Posterior segment;

Lymphoma;

Malignant melanoma;

Multiple sclerosis;

Reticulum cell sarcoma;

Retinitis pigmentosa;

Retinoblastoma;



Symptoms.

 Redness of the eye;

 Blurred vision;

 Sensitivity to light;

 Dark, floating spots along the visual field;

 Eye pain;



Treatment.

The prognosis is generally good for those who receive prompt diagnosis and treatment, but serious complication (including cataracts, glaucoma, band keratopathy, retinal edema and permanent vision loss) may result if left untreated. The type of uveitis, as well as its severity, duration, and responsiveness to treatment or any associated illnesses, all factor in to the outlook.



Uveitis is typically treated with glucocorticoid steroids, either as topical eye drops (such as betamethasone, dexamethasone or prednisolone) or oral therapy with prednisolone tablets. In addition topical cycloplegics, such as atropine or homatropine, may be used.



Antimetabolite medications, such as methotrexate are often used for recalcitrant or more aggressive cases of uveitis.  Experimental treatment with Infliximab infusions may prove helpful.

1253462,Election Night Special,"""Election Night Special"" is a Monty Python sketch parodying the coverage of United Kingdom general elections, specifically the 1970 general election on the BBC by including hectic (and downright silly) actions by the media and a range of ridiculous candidates. 



Throughout the sketch, the Linkman (John Cleese) excitedly reports the results of the elections in Leicester, Luton, Harpenden, and other municipalities. Usually the two major parties are the Sensible Party and the Silly Party, though occasional third-party candidates (Slightly Silly, Very Silly) make their appearance. The Blackadder episode Dish and Dishonesty features an election scene which clearly owes a debt to this sketch.



This sketch was featured in Episode 19 of the Monty Python's Flying Circus TV series, which aired November 3, 1970. A somewhat different version of the sketch (leading into The Lumberjack Song) was also featured on the Monty Python Live at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane album.

Notes.

 Among other changes: The live version at Drury Lane gave a much shorter name to the Very Silly candidate in Harpenden and changed some of the first syllables of Tarquin's surname, making it Fin-tim-lim-bim-(brief pause)lim-bim-bim-bim-bim. Sensible Candidate James Walker became Jeannette Walker, and Silly Candidate Jethro Q. Walrustitty was referred to as Jethro Q. Bunn Whackett Buzzard Stubble and Boot Walrustitty (""Bun, Whacket, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot"" was an early name considered for what became ""Monty Python.""). Elsie Zzzzzzzzzzzz was also referred to as Mrs rather than Mr.

The changed name for the aformentioned Very Silly candidate was ""Malcolm Peter Brian Telescope Adrian Blackpool Rock Stoatgobbler John Raw Vegetable Brrroooo Norman Michael (rings bell) (blows whistle) Edward (sounds car horn) (does train impersonation) (sounds buzzer) Thomas Moo... (sings) ""We'll keep a welcome in the..."" (fires gun) William (sound of whoopee whistle) ""Raindrops keep falling on my"" (weird noise) ""Don't sleep in the subway"" (cuckoo cuckoo) Naaoooo...

Early history (1920s-1950).

Recent history (1950-1990).

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Troop 152, sponsored by Saint Patrick's Church, Frederiksted, Saint Croix, formed a steel band of grammar-school-age Scouts that was managed by Vivian Bennerson.  The band toured internationally.  As of 2004, the Greathouse in Estate Diamond, Saint Croix that served as Boy Scout Headquarters for the island was deserted; possibly the destruction of Hurricane Hugo caused its abandonment.  



Scouting in the U.S. Virgin Islands today.



There is only one Boy Scouts of America local council in the United States Virgin Islands, eponymously named the Virgin Islands Council. Originally part of the Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands Council, the political entities were separated administratively in 1960.



The Howard M. Wall Scout Camp at Milord Point Beach on Saint Croix near Great Pond (Saint Croix) on the southeast end of the island is meant to accommodate up to 150 campers. It has a bath house (with two separated banks of showers and two rooms of latrines) and a mess hall. The Boy Scouts use the facility during two brief periods a year. There are plans in place to construct new indoor housing and upgrade at a cost of $500,000.



From time to time there have been discussions on opening the camp facility to Scout groups from other Councils.

Scouting in the British Virgin Islands.



The Scout Association of the British Virgin Islands operates as a branch of the United Kingdom Scout Association, due to the British Virgin Islands' affiliation as a Crown Colony of the United Kingdom. The BVI Scout Oath and Law, as well as other Scouting requirements, closely follow that of the United Kingdom. 



Although the program activities are taken from the British system, BVI Scouting is geared to the Caribbean way of life. Training for Wood Badge and leader training are conducted with the help of British and nearby Caribbean Scout associations. BVI Scouts participate in numerous Caribbean camps and events.

He was also a minister and believed that ""God"" was calling him to help The Grateful Dead. They made him their manager in 1969. 



As the story goes, Lenny Hart was responsible for disappearing with large profits (approx. US$155,000) in March 1970. The Grateful Dead song He's Gone is based on this event. As a result of the fiasco, Mickey Hart left the band in February 1971, not returning to the group on a full-time basis until 1975. 



In the later years of his life (before dying of stomach cancer), Lenny Hart dedicated himself to the creation and formulation of theories and ""methods"" to teach the joys of music and rhythm to children, most notably those who were deaf or hearing-impaired. His workbooks contained a strong psychological element of applied art therapy."
290389,GHQ Line,"The GHQ Line (General Headquarters Line) was a defence line built in the United Kingdom during World War II to contain an expected German invasion. 



The British Army had abandoned most of its equipment in France after the Dunkirk evacuation. It was therefore decided to build a static system of defensive lines around England, all designed to compartmentalise the country and delay the Germans long enough for more mobile forces to counter-attack.  Over 50 defensive lines were constructed around England, the GHQ Line being the longest and most important, designed to protect London and the industrial heart of England.



The GHQ Line ran from the northern end of the Taunton Stop Line near Highbridge in Somerset, along the River Brue and the Kennet and Avon Canal to Reading, around the south of London south of Guildford and Aldershot, to Canvey Island and Great Chesterford in Essex, before heading north to end in Yorkshire.



On the section of the line in Essex, between Great Chesterford and Canvey Island, the defences were made up of around 400 concrete ""pillboxes"", anti-tank obstacles, trenches and minefields which took advantage of natural and man made features. Over 100 pillboxes could still be seen on this section in 2003.

7401780,Bass effects,"Bass effects are electronic devices used to modify the tone, pitch or sound or electric bass guitars. Effects can be housed in effects pedals, bass amplifiers, bass amplifier simulation software, and rackmount preamplifiers or processors. While they are not used as often as guitar effects, bass effects still play an important role in many genres such as rock, metal, blues and funk.



Types of Bass Effects.

Distortion-Related Effects.



Distortion effects include distortion, overdrive and fuzz.



Distortion is an important part of an electric guitar's sound in many genres, particularly for rock, hard rock, metal and sludge. A distortion pedal takes a normal electric guitar signal and distorts the signal's waveform by ""clipping"" the signal. There are several different types of distortion effects, each with distinct sonic characteristics.



Some distortion effects provide an ""overdrive"" effect. Either by using a vacuum tube, or by using simulated tube modelling techniques, the top of the wave form is compressed, thus giving a smoother distorted signal than regular distortion effects. When an overdrive effect is used at a high setting, the sound's waveform can become clipped, which imparts a gritty or ""dirty"" tone, which sounds like a tube amplifier ""driven"" to its limit.



Fuzz is intended to recreate the classic 1960's tone of an overdriven tube amp combined with torn speaker cones.



Equalization-Related Effects.



Equalization effects include equalizer, wah, auto-wah and phase shifters. 



An Equalizer adjusts the frequency response in a number of different frequency bands. A graphic equalizer (or ""graphic EQ"") provides slider controls for a number of frequency region. Each of these bands has a fixed width (Q) and a fixed center-frequency, and as such, the slider changes only the level of the frequency band. The tone controls on guitars, guitar amps, and most pedals are similarly fixed-Q and fixed-frequency, but unlike a graphic EQ, rotary controls are used rather than sliders.

A Phase Shifter creates a complex frequency response containing many regularly-spaced ""notches"" in an incoming signal by combining it with a copy of itself out of phase, and shifting the phase relationship cyclically. The phasing effect creates a ""whooshing"" sound that is reminiscent of the sound of a flying jet.

A Wah pedal is a foot-operated pedal is technically a kind of band-pass filter, which allows only a small portion of the incoming signal's frequencies to pass. Rocking the pedal back and forth alternately allows lower and higher frequencies to pass through, the effect being similar to a person saying ""wah"". 

An Auto-Wah is a Wah pedal without a rocker pedal, controlled instead by the dynamic envelope of the signal. An auto-wah, also called more technically an envelope filter, uses the level of the guitar signal to control the wah filter position, so that as a note is played, it automatically starts with the sound of a wah pedal pulled back, and then quickly changes to the sound of a wah pedal pushed forward, or the reverse movement depending on the settings.



Time-Based Effects.



Time-based effects include delay/echo, chorus and looping.



A Delay or Echo pedal creates a copy of an incoming sound and slightly time-delays it, creating either a ""slap"" (single repetition) or an echo (multiple repetitions) effect.



Chorus uses a cycling, variable delay time that is short so that individual repetitions are not heard. The result is a thick, ""swirling"" sound that suggests multiple instruments playing in unison (chorus) that are slightly out of tune.



Extremely long delay times form a looping pedal, which allows  performers to record a phrase or passage and play along with it. This allows a solo performer to record an accompaniment or ostinato passage and then, with the looping pedal playing back this passage, perform solo improvisations over the accompaniment.



Pitch-related Effects.



Some pitch related effects are octavers and pitch shifters.



An Octaver mixes the input signal with a synthesised signal whose musical tone is an octave lower or higher than the original.



A pitch shifter is a device that alters the pitch of the instruments.  They are generally used with an expression pedal to give a smooth bend-like effect.



Multi-effects Pedals.



A multi-FX pedal is a single effects device that contains a number of different effects in it. Some multi-FX pedals contain modelled versions of classic effects pedals or amplifiers."

His son Stan Seymour Jnr later became chairman of Newcastle."
1530122,Synaxarium,"Synaxarium, Synaxarion, Synexarium, Synexarion, pl. Synaxaria (Greek:           , from         , synagein, to bring together; cf. etymology  of ""synaxis"" and ""synagogue"") , the name given in the Eastern Orthodox Church to a compilation of hagiographies corresponding very closely to the martyrology of the Roman Church.



There are two kinds of synaxaria:



Simple Synaxaria: lists of the saints arranged in the order of their anniversaries, e.g. the calendar of Morcelli;

Historical Synaxaria: including biographical notices, e.g. the menology of Basil and the synaxarium of Sirmond. The notices given in the historical synaxaria are summaries of those in the great menologies, or collections of lives of saints, for the twelve months of the year. As the lessons in the Byzantine Divine Office are always lives of saints, the Synaxarion became the collection of short lives of saints and accounts of events whose memory is kept.



Definitions.



The exact meaning of the name has changed at various times. Its first use was for the index to the Biblical and other lessons to be read in church. In this sense it corresponds to the Latin Capitulare and Comes. Then the Synaxarion was filled up with the whole text of the pericopes to be read. As far as the Holy Liturgy was concerned this meant that it was replaced by the ""Gospel"" and ""Apostle"" books. Synaxarion remained the title for the index to the other lessons. Without changing its name it was filled up with complete texts of these lessons in the same way. The mere index of such lessons is generally called menologion heortastikon, a book hardly needed or used, since the Typikon supplies all that is wanted. 



The parallel to the Roman Martyrology would be more exact, if we imagine the second nocturn lessons arranged together in a separate book.  



Certain metrical calendars extant in the Middle Ages were also called Synaxaria. Krumbacher (""Gesch. der byzantin, Lit."", 2nd ed., Munich, 1897, pp. 738, 755) describes those composed by Christopher of Mytilene (d. about 1050) and Theodore Prodromus (twelfth century). 



Examples.

The oldest historical synaxaria apparently go back to the tenth century. There are a great number of medieval Synaxaria extant in manuscript. They are important for Byzantine heortology and church history. The short lives that form the lessons were composed or collected by various writers. Of these Symeon Metaphrastes is the most important. The accounts are of very varying historical value. Emperor Basil II (976-1025) ordered a revision of the Synaxarion, which forms an important element of the present official edition (Analecta Bollandiana, XIV, 1895, p. 404). The Synaxarion is not now used as a separate book; it is incorporated in the Menaia. The account of the saint or feast is read in the Orthros after the sixth ode of the Canon. It is printed in its place here, and bears each time the name synaxarion as title. Synaxarion then in modern use means, not the whole collection, but each separate lesson in the Menaia and other books. An example of such a Synaxarion (for St. Martin I, 13 April) will be found in Nilles, op. cit., infra, I, xlix. 



Eastern Orthodox Church.

The Eastern churches also have their synaxaria. The publication of the Arabic text of the synaxarium or the Church of Alexandria was started simultaneously by J. Forget in the Corp. script. orient. and by R. Basset in the Patrologia Orientalis, and that of the Ethiopian synaxarium was begun by I. Guidi in the Patrologia orient. The Armenian synaxarium, called the synaxarium of Ter Israel, was published at Constantinople in 1834.

883599,Icehouse (band),"Icehouse is an Australian band, originally billed as Flowers, best known in Australia in the late 1970s Sydney pub scene and later in the early to mid 80s for more mainstream success and radio airplay.



They were early pioneers in the use of synthesizers in popular music.



Overview.

They were formed in 1977 as Flowers by Iva Davies (born Ivor Arthur Davies, on 22 May, 1955, in Wauchope, New South Wales, Australia), who was the main creative force, and a classically trained musician; and bass player, Keith Welsh. for a number of years they also obtained the services of Bob Kretschmer, until he was replaced by young guitarist Paul Gildea.



Since 1980 Icehouse has released seven albums, several compilations, and music from collaborations with other artists including dance companies. The 1987 album Man of Colours was released at the apex of their fame and international success.



Albums.



As Flowers, Icehouse built up a strong following as a live act around Sydney, noted for their distinctive cover versions of songs by a wide range of acts including T-Rex and Brian Eno. After signing to the Regular Festival Records label, they released their first album Icehouse in 1980, which became a hit in Australia.  The single from this album, also called ""Icehouse"", created some interest in the U.K., partly because of a memorable video. Other singles included ""Can't Help Myself"" and ""Walls"". The album made use of synthesisers, especially the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5.



Their next album release was Primitive Man, recorded with assistance from Keith Forsey, who later worked with Simple Minds.  This album was the source of the international hit-single ""Hey Little Girl"", which has remained their most regularly played single.  Another strong track from this album was ""Great Southern Land"", which featured in the late 1980s film Young Einstein.



In 1985 Davies' musical standing was further enhanced when he was commissioned to compose and record the score for the acclaimed Sydney Dance Company production of Graeme Murphy's dance work Boxes.



Icehouse's third album, Sidewalk, was far more sombre and reflective, featuring the tracks ""I Don't Believe Anymore"" and ""Someone Like You"".  After this album the band made further inroads into the U.S. market with their 1986 release Measure for Measure.



The next album, Man of Colours, was their best-selling album.  It contained the hit singles ""Crazy"" and ""Electric Blue"" (a song co-written by John Oates from the band Hall and Oates).  With this album, the band reached an international zenith, never surpassing this level of popularity and exposure again.





Recent history.

In 1995, Davies was again involved with the Sydney Dance Company's production of Berlin. The musical score is a collection of cover versions of songs by David Bowie, Brian Eno, Simple Minds, The Psychedelic Furs, Frank Sinatra, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, XTC, Talking Heads, The Velvet Underground, PiL, The Cure and Killing Joke, which saw him collaborating with pianist Max Lambert in the development of the music.



As well as recording the score to the ballet, Davies performed these songs live with Icehouse at each show.  He was an intrinsic part of the ballet, in a role similar to the one in Boxes.  Iva was extremely successful in creating a translation from the dancers to the audience.  Berlin was an instant success and ran for two seasons.  Both shows were the most commercially successful that The Sydney Dance Company have had to date.



In 2002 Don't Believe Anymore from Sidewalk (1984) was covered by The Whitlams on their album Torch The Moon.



In 2003 Iva Davies contributed to the score of the film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.



16 August 2006, Icehouse were inducted into the ARIA  Hall of Fame.



A number of Icehouse songs featured in the Triple M Essential 2006 Countdown. The songs are as follows:

 Man Of Colours (1748/2006);

Leeds Rhinos.

After signing for Leeds in July 1996 ""Junior"", as he was known, became an integral part of the Rhinos seventeen-man game plan, especially under coach Graham Murray. 

Marcus was signed from Huddersfield in July 1996 and was voted the Yorkshire Evening Post/Leeds Rhinos Shooting Star of 1998 as the most improved player. 

A brilliant runner with the ball, all to often injuries prevented from gaining the confidence he needed to shine in the Leeds colours after 1999, the high point of his time at Headingley. 

In total he made 65 starts for Leeds plus 46 substitute appearances leading to a total of 111 appearances. He scored 39 tries to give him a haul of 156 points.

St Hilaire was a try scorer at Wembley in the 1999 Challenge Cup Final when he was used in his accustomed role of coming on at full back to allow Iestyn Harris to move up to stand off in the second half of games.

Midway through the 2002 season, St Hilaire was released from the final year of his contract and rejoined Huddersfield, where he helped the Giants regain their place in Super League.

594329,Line of battle,"In naval warfare, line astern or line of battle is a tactic in which the ships of the fleet form a line, end-to-end. Its origins are traditionally ascribed to the navy of the Commonwealth of England, especially to General at Sea Robert Blake who wrote the Sailing and Fighting Instructions of 1653. 



The line of battle has the advantage over previous naval tactics   in which ships closed on each other for individual combat   that each ship in the line can fire its broadside without fear of hitting a friendly ship. Therefore in any given amount of time more shots can be fired by the entire fleet. Another advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. To fend off this possibility the other fleet too can move in a line, with the result so typical for sea battle since 1675: two fleets sailing along each other or in opposite tack. A ship powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be known as a ""ship of the line"" (of battle) or a ""line of battle"" ship which shortened to become ""battleship"". The line is at its most effective when moving perpendicular to the axis of movement of the enemy fleet, e.g. by ""crossing the T"" or by breaking the enemy line and moving through it (e.g. Four Days Battle, Battle of Schooneveld, Battle of Trafalgar), by trying to cut off and isolate part of the enemy's line and concentrating a stronger force on it (e.g. Battle of Texel, Battle of the Saintes), or by trying to 'double up' the enemy's ships (e.g. Battle of Beachy Head). This way the enemy ships block each other's line of fire.



Development of the Line of Battle.



From the mid 16th Century the cannon gradually became the most important weapon in naval warfare, replacing boarding actions as the decisive factor in combat. At the same time, the natural tendency in the design of galleons was for longer ships with lower castles, which meant faster, more stable vessels. These newer warships could mount more cannon along the sides of their decks, concentrating their firepower along their broadside. Until the mid 17th Century, the tactics of a fleet were often to 'charge' the enemy, firing bow-chaser cannon, which did not deploy the broadside to its best effect.



During the 17th Century admirals gradually identified the line ahead formation as being the best way to deploy their growing firepower.  



The Line in the Age of Sail.



The Anglo-Dutch Wars.



Modern research has shown that the first documented deliberate use seems to be in the Action of 18 September 1639 by Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp who employed it to damage a Spanish fleet, far superior in numbers and firepower, so severely it took refuge in The Downs where he would destroy it five weeks later in the Battle of the Downs. The United Provinces, however, did not formalise it into an official doctrine.



In the 1652 battles of the First Anglo-Dutch War the Dutch again used the line-of-battle when trying to defend themselves against the heavier English vessels. On 29 March 1653, the English issued the 'Instructions for the better ordering of the Fleet in Fighting', instructing each of the three squadrons of their fleet to 'keep in line with their chief' and ships out of station to return to the 'wake or grain' of their flagship.



The next major battle of the war, the Battle of the Gabbard, was a decisive English victory and caused severe losses to the Dutch fleet. 



After this war the English perfected the method; but the Dutch were slower to adopt the modern tactic, still having no written instructions when the Second Anglo-Dutch War broke out. An attempt to employ the line-of-battle against the English by Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam failed catastrophically in the Battle of Lowestoft due to insufficient training and confusion among the lower ranks whether the line should be used or the direct attack. In the summer of 1665 the Dutch too wrote formal instructions. Michiel de Ruyter used the line-of-battle with great ability in the Four Days Battle. That the English were still more competent in it was shown in the St. James's Day Battle when they recovered much earlier from exceptional weather conditions causing large manpower losses to the Dutch.



In the Third Anglo-Dutch War the Dutch had full mastery of the tactic as is evident by the events during the Battle of Schooneveld. 



The 18th Century.



During the 18th Century the British became rather dogmatic about the line-of-battle, trying to employ it even in unfavourable conditions, as shown in the Battle of Beachy Head and the Battles of Barfleur and La Hougue, where the French gained an advantage because of British inflexibility. This worsened during the 18th century when the line-of-battle became a dogmatic doctrine; in 1778, at the Battle of Ushant, the French escaped, in part due to British over-reliance on the line. Nevertheless, the lateness of the fleet in forming the line became the pretext for the politically-motivated court-martials of Admirals Keppel and Palliser.



After further reverses in the American Revolutionary Wars, where British lines proved vulnerable to faster French warships using hit-and-run tactics, the Royal Navy became receptive to new ideas about the line tactic. John Clerk, an Edinburgh merchant, published a book called 'An Essay on Naval Tactics', emphasising the need to concentrate fire on a part of the enemy's line of battle. The book circulated widely, including to naval officers.



At the Battle of the Saints in 1781 a British fleet under Admiral Rodney broke across the enemy line instead of keeping their own line intact at all costs. Whether this was deliberate, or indeed desirable, was and still is disputed. The result was nevertheless hailed as the greatest victory since the Seven Years War.  The Battle of the First of June (1794) saw a return to the mêlée. British admirals, Nelson amongst them, continued to develop offensive modifications to the simple line ahead tactic throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.



Sail Line Tactics.



For a time sea-officers were inclined to doubt whether order could be maintained among vessels subject to the forces of wind and tide. But, in the very first years of the 16th century, the Spanish writer Alonso de Chaves argued that even an approach to order was superior to none, and that, given the accidents of wind and tide, and given that the early means of injuring an enemy at a distance were nil, the advantage would rest with the one who took his precautions. This truth was so obvious that it could not help but be universally accepted. The line ahead then became the ""line of battle"".



The governing principles were simple and were essentially sound. The ships were arranged in a line, in order that each should have her broadside free to fire into the enemy without running the risk of firing into her own friends. In order to remove the danger that they would collide and allow for a change of course in case of need, a space was left between them. It was fixed at two cables     that is, 200 fathoms, or 400 yards     though less room was occasionally taken.



In a large fleet, the line was typically divided into three squadrons, or divisions, each under a subordinate admiral.  Note that, unlike land armies, there is no advanced guard, rear guard, and vanguard (a.k.a. Main Body) because changes in wind direction, sailing direction, and position of the enemy fleet would make this too confusing.  Rather, one squadron usually remained under the direct command of the Admiral of the Fleet, one squadron was commanded by a Vice Admiral and one by a Rear Admiral, each of the three squadrons flying different coloured flags. The flag of the Fleet Admiral's squadron is red, the Vice Admiral's is white and the Rear Admiral's blue.  Although the names Vice (advanced) and Rear may have derived from sailing positions within the line at the moment of engagement it was more common to refer to squadrons by their colour, or by the name and the admiral's ship and, in conversation but not in signals, by the name of the commander.



To reduce the number of men required to handle the sails, and leave them free to fight the guns, the ships fought under reduced canvas. But it was necessary to retain the power to increase the speed of a ship rapidly. This was secured by not sheeting home one of the sails   that is to say, it was left loose, and the wind was ""spilt out of it"". When the vessel was required to shoot ahead it was easy to sheet the sail home, and ""let all draw"". The fleets would fight ""on the wind""   that is to say, with the wind on the side, because they were then under better control. With the wind blowing from behind they would take the wind out of one another s sails. When the course had to be altered, the ships turned by tacking   that is, head to wind   or by wearing   that is, stern to wind, either together or in succession. 



To tack or wear a large fleet in succession was a very lengthy operation. The second ship did not tack, or wear, till she had reached the place where the first had turned, and so on, down the whole line. By tacking or wearing together the order of a fleet was reversed, the forward sqaudron becoming the rear, and the rear the van. It must be remembered that a fleet was divided into squadrons, which kept their names even when the order was reversed. Orders were given by signals from the flagship, but as they could not always be seen by the ships in a line with her, frigates were stationed on the disengaged side of the line to repeat signals. 



A main object which the admirals who drafted the British Sailing and Fighting Instructions had before them was to obviate the risk that the enemy would double on one end of the line and put it between two fires. It is obvious that if two fleets, A and B, are sailing, both with the wind on the starboard side, and the leading ship of A comes into action with the seventh or eighth of B, then six or seven leading ships of B s line will be free to turn and surround the head of A s line, a tactic known as doubling. This actually happened at the Battle of Beachy Head (1690). Therefore, the orders enjoin on the admiral the strict obligation to come into action in such a way that his leading ship shall steer with the leading ship of the enemy, and his rear with the rear. The familiar expression of the British navy was ""to take every man his bird"". 



The regular method of fighting battles was thus set up. In itself it was founded on sound principles. As it was framed when the enemies kept in view were the Dutch, who in seamanship, strategy and tactics and gunnery were fully equal to the British, its authors were justified in prescribing the safe course. Unhappily they added the direction that a British admiral was to keep his fleet, throughout the battle, in the order in which it was begun. Therefore he could take no advantage of any disorder which might occur in the enemy s lines.



The Line in the Age of Steam.



The logic of the line of battle remained true even through many evolutions of naval technology in the 19th and early 20th century. With very few exceptions, gun-armed ships continued to bring their greatest fire to bear on their broadside. There was a brief period in the late 19th century when ramming became a popular method of attack, for instance at the Battle of Lissa or the Battle of the Yalu River, which both used markedly different tactics. However, ramming fell out of fashion again, and by 1900 the line of battle was back, used in the Battle of Tsushima of 1905, the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and finally in the the Battle of Surigao Strait in 1944.



During World War II the development of aircraft carriers and the guided missile meant that gun engagements would never again be decisive. This meant there was no rationale for using a line-of-battle formation. In modern naval warfare, a battlegroup generally deploys with the highest-value units in the centre, accompanied closely by anti-aircraft escorts, with a number of anti-submarine escorts surrounding the formation at a distance of tens of miles.



In fiction.



Some military science fiction works revive the term ""battle-line"", or its 3D analogon, ""wall of battle"", to refer to the heavy warships of a space fleet.

193960,Steve Bell (cartoonist),"For the Canadian musician, see Steve Bell (musician).;





Steve Bell (born February 26, 1951) is an English political cartoonist, whose work appears in The Guardian and other places. He is known for his left-wing views and distinctive caricatures.



Born in Walthamstow, London and raised in Slough, Bell moved to North Yorkshire with his family in 1968, where he trained as an artist at the Teesside College of Art as well as the University of Leeds. He was briefly an art teacher in Birmingham before becoming a freelance cartoonist in 1977. His comic strip Maggie's Farm appeared in the London listings magazines Time Out from 1979 and later in City Limits. In 1980, he contributed a cartoon interpretation of the lyrics to Ivan Meets G.I. Joe to the inner lyric bag of The Clash's triple album Sandinista!.



Steve Bell is perhaps best-known for the daily strip called If..., which has appeared in The Guardian newspaper since 1981, and since the mid-1990s he has also been that newspaper's principal editorial cartoonist. One of Bell's most traditional caricatures is of John Major as a dire superhero wearing his Y-fronts on the outside of his clothes (and indeed Major later admitted he tucked his shirt into his underwear). He has won many awards for his work, including both the political and strip cartoon categories at the Cartoon Arts Trust awards in 1997.



Many collections of his cartoons have been published, and he has also illustrated original books in collaboration with several authors. He has made short animated films with Bob Godfrey, and a radio programme about the life of 18th century caricaturist James Gillray. He has also drawn the Gremlins comic strip for the British comic Jackpot.



In 2003, he was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. When he received the award in 2004 for Best Daily Cartoonist, in his speech he thanked ""George Bush - for looking like a monkey, walking like a monkey and talking like a monkey"".



Opinions are divided about the merits of Steve Bell's work.  Like most cartoonists he uses running gags, and therefore seems funnier to regular than to occasional readers.   But even among Guardian aficionados, there is an ongoing Bell vs Garry Trudeau (and therefore If... vs Doonesbury) debate, occasionally spilling onto the paper's Letters page, which exists mainly because the two comic strips were, for many years, carried by the Guardian next to each other.  The debate is as much about taste as anything else, prompted for example by Bell's typical juxtaposition of toilet humour with high art.  He is fond of parodying famous paintings. Examples include his parody of Goya's The Sleep of Reason Brings Forth Monsters (in an editorial cartoon about the UK Independence Party); William Hogarth's The Gates of Calais about the ban on UK meat exports following outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and bovine BSE; and - before the 2005 General Election when it briefly seemed as if the Liberal Democrats might seriously threaten Labour - J.M.W. Turner's The Fighting Temeraire), in which a chirpy Charles Kennedy as tug-boat towed a grotesque and dilapidated Tony Blair to be broken up. Bell is also fond of using the pejorative British word ""wanker"" and its euphemistic variants in his If... comic strip.

 Plot .

In September  1991  the swordfishing boat Andrea Gail  returns to home port in Gloucester, Massachusetts  with a poor catch. Desperate for money the captain convinces his reluctant crew to join him for one more fishing expedition. They head out past their usual fishing grounds, leaving a developing storm behind them. They find great success at the Flemish Cap, but when their ice machine breaks the only way to preserve their catch is to hurry back home. However between the Andrea Gail and Gloucester is a confluence of 2 powerful weather fronts and a hurricane. The crew struggles to sail through pounding waves and shrieking winds, while friends and family worry and wait for a ship that may never come home.2



 Reaction .    	

The families of certain crew members disliked the movie and sued the producers in federal district court in Florida. The district court held that the defendants' First Amendment right to freedom of speech barred the suit. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which could not decide how to interpret the Florida law at issue and certified the question to the Florida Supreme Court. On April 21, 2005, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the district court's interpretation of Florida law and remanded the case to the 11th Circuit, which then affirmed the district court's original decision to dismiss the case.

Plot.

Edina Monsoon and Patsy Stone are two immature, prosperous, but preposterous substance-abusing fashion and fad-obsessed Londoners who value fame and style over substance (unless they are controlled substances). Saffron, Edina's daughter, provides the persistently dour voice of Monsoon and Stone's superego. Edina and Saffy live in a house in Holland Park, with Patsy spending most of her time there as well. 



The programme circles around Eddy's constant struggle to achieve fame and success amidst the disapproval of her daughter and the constant presence of her increasingly senile mother. Throughout, Patsy is at her side encouraging the behaviours that are constantly causing her conflict. Much of the comedy of the show is physical, usually derived from Edina and Patsy's drunken and/or stoned states, with their favourite drinks being ""Bolli Stoli"" (a cocktail of Bollinger champagne and Stolichnaya vodka) and later ""Veuve Bourbs"" (a mix of Veuve Clicquot champagne and bourbon). The mutual loathing between Saffy and Patsy as each tries to guide Edina's behaviour also makes for many comic situations. A recurring gag found new ways for Edina to fall headfirst out of cars, windows, or down her kitchen stairs at least once every series.



Characters.

Eddy.

Edwina Margaret Rose Monsoon was born on 6 August 1951 in London.  She later changed her name to Edina and is nearly always called Eddy; only her mother, and once Justin, calls her Edwina. She owns a public relations firm whose only steady client is 1960s pop singer Lulu, who is barely hanging on by a thread. In later years, this was switched to model Twiggy and former Spice Girl Emma Bunton, who also went to school with Saffy. Though failing in her business, Edina is desperate to give off the aura of success, wealth and fabulousness, even as her outrageously mismatched and poorly-fitted wardrobe belies this. In an early episode, Edina says that she has always voted Labour, but she notes her disdain for New Labour in the fourth series. She collects hefty alimony payments from her two ex-husbands, Justin and Marshall. Justin, Saffy's father, is gay and for a time had a boyfriend named Oliver. Her first husband, Marshall Turtle, the father of her gay and perpetually off-screen son Serge, later marries scheming New-Age Californian Bo Chrysalis.



Patsy.

Eurydice Colette Clytemnestra Dido Bathsheba Rabelais Patricia Cocteau Stone, always called Patsy, is an outrageous, nymphomaniacal, chain-smoking, past-her-prime fashion model who drinks like a fish. She shares a codependent parasitic existence with her old schoolfriend Eddy. This relationship usually results in hilarious, albeit dysfunctional, behaviour and over-the-top conflicts. Unlike Eddy, she is always stylishly dressed, and had a well-paying, do-nothing job with a fashion magazine, which she received after sleeping with the publisher. She then went on to work in ""Jeremy's"" an exclusive high street fashion store, with clients such as Minnie Driver. Patsy was born in Paris, and her birthday is 30 October, although her actual age is never divulged and she often states herself to be ""39"" or ""41"". Her mother was very promiscuous, and neglected Patsy, treating her more as a rival than a daughter. There are several none-too-subtle hints that during the 1970s Patsy underwent a sex change and briefly lived as a man; however, as Eddy reveals, ""it fell off"".  Patsy also has an older sister, Jackie, whom Eddy abhors and who once tried to kill Patsy. In two earlier episodes (""Door Handle"" and ""The Last Shout""), it is revealed that Patsy lives in the storeroom above Oddbins, a UK chain liquor store.



Saffy.

Edina and Justin's daughter Saffron was born on 17 March 1975 in London. Although most people call her ""Saffy"", she is also frequently referred to by Eddy as ""sweetie"", ""darling"", or ""sweetie darling"" and (by Patsy) as ""the bitch troll from hell"" or ""the bitch daughter"". She is the perfect foil for Eddy and Patsy, depicted as the ever-virtuous high-minded intellectual who endures bombastic abuse and immature snideness from both, especially with regard to sex.  She is the voice of reason, a thankless job in the Monsoon household. After completing her education, she takes up writing in series four; at one point, she becomes involved with New Labour, and says her role model is Cherie Blair. In series five, when she returns home pregnant from a stint of humanitarian work in Africa, Eddy is at first aghast at the prospect of being a grandmother; that is, until she learns that the father is black, making the baby multiracial and, as such, an utterly fabulous fashion accessory (""A mixed race baby is the Chanel of babies!""). Saffy later gives birth to a daughter called Jane, although Eddy persists in referring to her as 'Lola'. Saffy is the legal owner of the house.



Gran/Mrs. Monsoon.

Edina's mother, Mrs. Monsoon, is an average, sensible woman despised by her daughter but much loved by her granddaughter Saffy. Patsy seems to tolerate ""Mrs. M"" and even helps her to do chores. In the first few series, she is a valuable ally for Saffy in her struggle for domestic control, often mentioning embarrassing facts from Eddy's and Patsy's early lives. After series three, however, her mental faculties begin to decline and she increasingly inhabits a strange world of her own. Eddy addresses her, usually indirectly, as ""The Old Woman"", never as ""Mum"", ""Mummy"", or even ""Mother"". In only one scene throughout the entire run of the show are the two alone together, and it's an awkward experience for them both. When Gran's husband, affectionately known as ""Daddy"", dies during series 2, Eddy infuriates Saffy by responding to the news with a blank stare and the question ""Did he leave a will?""; Gran, however, doesn't seem to care much either.  She appears in flashbacks of Edina's past wearing the stereotypical housewife's clothing of the 1960s.



Bubble.

Eddy's secretary Bubble, a charming disaster, can't remember what a television is called but can speak several foreign languages. Bubble's cousin Katy Grin is a television presenter trying to make the big time again after having a baby.



Episodes.





Absolutely Fabulous first aired on 12 November 1992, and ran for three series until 4 May 1995, when the sixth episode of series 3 was billed as the last-ever episode. However, the following year in November 1996, two specials, called ""The Last Shout"", were broadcast and were also billed as the last-ever episodes. Both 'last episodes' featured end sequences with flashes to the future. However, after writing Mirrorball, Jennifer Saunders decided she had more ideas , and on 31 August 2001 the fourth series premiered. A further series and three specials followed, the last of which aired on 25 December 2004. In July 2005, Saunders announced she would not be writing or playing Edina again, stating ""The 6am calls to go to make-up and all the promotional work wear you down. I would like to write and direct   that would be my joy"".



Theme song.

The theme song for Ab Fab is called This Wheel's on Fire written by Bob Dylan and Rick Danko and performed in this instance by Julie Driscoll and Adrian Edmondson. The song was also sung by Marianne Faithfull and P. P. Arnold for The Last Shout Special in 1996. This version does not appear on the new BBC Video DVD release. More recently, it has been sung by Blondie lead singer, Debbie Harry, who also guest-starred in the 2002 Christmas Special ""Gay"".



In addition to the official theme song, in 1994, the Pet Shop Boys recorded a song for Comic Relief using excerpts of dialogue from the series put to dance music. The music video featured clips from the show and specially recorded footage of the Pet Shop Boys with Patsy and Edina.



Following.

With its outlandish depictions of drug and alcohol abuse and irresponsible, irreverent, and frequently illegal behaviour, the series gained a large and loyal following, as well as attracting censure from various groups. The programme was widely popular in Britain, and gained noteworthy attention in other countries.



Other countries.

In the United States, Absolutely Fabulous has been broadcast on Comedy Central, PBS, BBC America, and since 2003 Oxygen Network as well. In Australia, all series were originally shown on the ABC, and on cable it airs on UK.TV. Repeats of the first three series were also shown on the Seven Network. The ABC continues to show it sporadically and shows Christmas Specials and occasional repeats of Series Five or Six episodes. In Canada it airs on Comedy Network and since 1994, CBC. In Serbia, the first series was aired in 1998, through a network of local television stations; in 2004 the series was aired in its entirety on B92 while in the Czech Republic all episodes have been shown. 



Remakes.

Absolutely Fabulous inspired a French feature film, called Absolument Fabuleux, in 2001. This was written and directed by Gabriel Aghion, and starred Josiane Balasko as Eddie and Nathalie Baye as Patsy.  Jennifer Saunders had a small cameo as a spectator at a fashion show. 



A proposed American remake that would have starred Carrie Fisher was put into motion by Roseanne Barr but never got off the ground. However, Barr did incorporate many elements of the show into the final season of her eponymous show Roseanne in which her character wins the lottery, even hiring Saunders and Lumley to reprise their Absolutely Fabulous characters Edina and Patsy in one episode. An American sitcom called ""High Society"", a direct remake of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" but toned down for American audiences, starring Jean Smart and Mary McDonnell, lasted only a shortened single season, but did garner an Emmy nomination for Jayne Meadows in the role of McDonnell's character's mother. The American sitcom Cybill, although not directly intended as a remake, shared some elements of Ab Fabs comedic style. In 2000, a short-lived Canadian version called P.R. also aired.



Mirrorball.

Mirrorball was a show written by Saunders that featured a completely different plot and set of characters, but starred all of the main cast of Absolutely Fabulous. While not being a remake or spin-off, it is the only time in British TV history that two identical casts were used in two totally different shows. Only a pilot of Mirrorball was ever made. 



DVD releases.

All episodes of Absolutely Fabulous have been released on DVD in Region 2 (UK), by 2 Entertain Video, with the exception of the 2004 Christmas Special. Series 1-5, in addition to the specials ""The Last Shout"" and ""Ab Fab: New York"" (Released under the title ""Absolutely Fabulous: Absolutely Special""), have also been released on DVD by Warner Brothers and BBC Video in Region 1 (US/Canada).  The original French and Saunders sketch is an 'extra' on the Series One DVD (on both the UK and US versions), and The pilot of Mirrorball is an extra on the DVD of Series 4. Each series' DVD also features a fifteen-minute outtake reel.

Regular season.

The Ottawa Senators, by far the smallest market in the league,were affected by franchises in the U.S. and, thus, escalating salaries, and were in financial trouble as a result and requested a bigger road receipt from the other teams. They also sold their star right wing Hooley Smith to the Montreal Maroons for $22,500 plus the return of right wing Punch Broadbent, followed by the sale of defenceman Ed Gorman to Toronto. Part of the problem was that fans in Ottawa tended to only attend games with Canadian opponents.



Howie Morenz, the NHL's top drawing card, dominated the scoring race and was runaway winner of the Hart Trophy. He scored 33 goals and led the league in assists as well. Despite Ottawa's financial difficulties, Alex Connell, Ottawa goalkeeper, set an all-time record with six consecutive shutouts or a period of 460 minutes and 59 seconds without being scored on.



Toronto, now the Maple Leafs, showed power early on and it looked like they would make the

playoffs. However, injuries to Hap Day and Bill Carson doomed the team and the Leafs

sagged to fourth and out of the playoffs.



Thanks to the great play of Eddie Shore and goaltender Hal Winkler, who tied with Connell for the leader in shutouts with 15, the Boston Bruins finished first for the first time in the American Division, while the Canadiens, who were running away with the Canadian Division at mid-season, slumped after an injury to Pit Lepine but managed to hold onto first place at season's end.

Stanley Cup playoffs.

In the Canadian Division,the Montreal Maroons beat the Ottawa Senators and then went to

the pulsating limit against the Canadiens before Russell Oatman put the Maroons into

the finals with a goal in overtime.



In the American Division, the New York Rangers knocked off the Pittsburgh Pirates in a rough series, and then beat Boston to go to the finals against the Montreal Maroons. The circus knocked the Rangers out of Madison Square Garden, and all games would be played in the Montreal Forum, even though Boston offered to host the Rangers. The Maroons won game one 2-0, with Nels Stewart and goaltender 

Clint Benedict the stars. Drama took over in game two when Nels Stewart fired a hard shot that struck New York goaltender Lorne Chabot in the eye. He could not continue, and the Rangers needed a goaltender. However, when coach Eddie Gerard refused to let the Rangers use Alex Connell or minor league goaltender Hugh McCormick, Lester Patrick, Ranger coach, in anger, decided to don the pads himself. The Rangers then body-blasted any Maroon who got near Patrick. Bill Cook scored, putting the Rangers ahead 1-0, but Nels Stewart was not to be denied and scored,tying the game. In overtime, Frank Boucher got the winner for the Rangers and they carried Patrick, tears streaming down his eyes, off the ice. 

Joe ""Red Light"" Miller, New York Americans goalie, was allowed to take Chabot's place in goal and he played well in a 2-0 loss in game three. However, Frank Boucher starred as the Rangers took the next two games, and the Stanley Cup. Drama almost took place in the final game when Miller was badly cut on a shot, but he was able to continue. The crowd became unruly at times and referee Mike Rodden took abuse for disallowed goals by Maroon players. Even NHL president Frank Calder was a target of some fans for not intervening. The Rangers became the second American team to win the Cup and the first NHL American team

to do so.

1793022,MAX Yellow Line,"The MAX Yellow Line is a 5.8 mile (9.3 km) (not including segments downtown shared with other lines) light rail route in the Metropolitan Area Express light rail system in Portland, Oregon. The route, which opened May 1, 2004, runs between downtown Portland and the Portland Expo Center. It is also known as the Interstate MAX because the majority of the line runs along Interstate Avenue in North Portland.



The Yellow Line is the newest MAX line. Originally, it was conceived as part of a north-south light rail project between Vancouver, Washington and Milwaukie to be built using city funds, but that plan was rejected by voters. TriMet then learned that a majority of the residents of North Portland had voted in favor of the original plan, so they decided to build this new line without using city funds. To do this, they convinced the City of Portland to create an urban renewal district along the proposed line, which made them eligible for matching federal funds with which they could finance the construction of the MAX line. The project was finished four months ahead of schedule at a budget of $320 million USD $25 million USD under budget. The presence of the line has also caused a great deal of redevelopment along its corridor.



Future plans.

The Yellow Line will move to the Portland Transit Mall once MAX tracks are put in there. Additionally, there are plans for extensions at both ends, from downtown Portland southward to Milwaukie as part of the MAX Orange Line (which will likely be a Yellow Line extension), and from the Expo Center into Vancouver, WA via Interstate 5 and SR-500.

7793854,Rownd a Rownd,"Rownd a Rownd is a television series on S4C. It was originally based on young people with paper rounds, but has since grown to include both their daily school and family life.



The series is filmed in Porthaethwy, Anglesey. An unrealistic factor about Rownd a Rownd is that it is filmed in the 

Summer months, but the story takes place in the Winter months, so it is always daylight in the morning, where darkness is expected.



The longest star of the series is Dewi 'Pws' Morris who has played the character of Islwyn Morgan, from the start in 1995."
220230,Bernardino of Siena,"Saint Bernardino of Siena (sometimes Bernardine, September 8 1380   May 20, 1444) was an Italian preacher, Franciscan missionary and Christian saint. 



Early life.

Bernardino was born in 1380 to the noble Albizeschi family in Massa Marittima (Tuscany), a Sienese town of which his father was then governor. Left orphaned at six, he was raised by a pious aunt. On the completion of his education he spent some years in the service of the sick in the hospitals. While he was studying civil and canon law in Siena, he worked in the hospital of Santa Maria della Scala throughout the bubonic plague outbreak of 1400 and even urged other young men to stay and help. He thus caught the plague, of which he nearly died.



In 1402 or 1404, he joined the Franciscan order in the strict branch called Observant, of which he became one of the chief promoters, after donating all his possessions to the poor. About 1406 Saint Vincent Ferrer, while preaching at Alessandria in Piedmont, foretold that his mantle should descend upon one who was then listening to him, and said that he would return to France and Spain leaving to Bernardino the task of evangelizing the remaining peoples of Italy. Nearly twelve years passed before this prediction was fulfilled. During this period, of which we have no details, Bernardino seems to have lived in retirement in the convent on the hill of Capriola, near Siena.



He was reported to ""cure"" a Sienese prostitute by striking her and ""driving the demon"" from her body. He then moved on to preach at Milan in 1418 (1417 according to other sources) before traveling to perform evangelical preaching in neighbouring cities in the next four years.



Work.

For more than 30 years Bernardino preached all over Italy, and played a great part in the religious revival of the early fifteenth century. His success was claimed to be remarkable. Enormous crowds came to hear him speak. It was said that feuds and factionalism were reconciled by his counsel and that miracles took place. Donations to the Holy Name of Jesus (which he preached particularly) increased dramatically. Furthermore, ""bonfires of vanities"" were held at his sermon sites, where people were encouraged to burn objects of temptation. In 1425, he preached every day for seven weeks in Siena.



In 1427 he was summoned to Rome to stand trial on charges of heresy, with theologians including Paulus Venetus present to give their opinions. Bernardino was found innocent of heresy, and he impressed Pope Martin V sufficiently that Martin requested he preach in Rome. He was acquitted and thereupon preached every day for 80 days. A typical sermon, would last for an hour long, but some lasted for more than four. Bernardino's zeal was such that he would prepare up to four drafts of a sermon before starting to speak. That same year, he was offered and declined the bishopric of Siena in order to maintain his monastic and evangelical activities. In 1431, he toured Tuscany, Lombardy, Romagna, and Ancona before returning to Siena to prevent a war against Florence. Also in 1431, he declined the bishopric of Ferrara, and in 1435 he declined the bishopric of Urbino.



Saint John Capistran was his friend, and Saint James of the Marches was his disciple during these years. Both Pope Martin V and Pope Eugene IV were urged by their cardinals to condemn Bernardino, but both almost instantly acquitted him. The Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund sought Bernardino's counsel and intercession and the future saint accompanied him to Rome in 1433 for his coronation. 



Soon after he withdrew again to Capriola to compose a series of sermons. He resumed his missionary labours in 1436, but was forced to abandon them in the following year, when he became vicar-general of the Observant branch of the Franciscans in Italy. In 1438, Bernardino was elevated to vicar-general of the Franciscan Order in Italy. This cut back his opportunities to preach, but he continued to speak to the public when he could. Having in 1442 persuaded the pope to accept his resignation as vicar-general so that he might give himself more undividedly to preaching, Bernardino resumed his missionary labours. Despite a Papal Bull issued by Eugene IV in 1443 and which charged Bernardino to preach the indulgence for the Crusade against the Turks, there is no record of his having done so. In 1444, notwithstanding his increasing infirmities, Bernardino, desirous that there should be no part of Italy which had not heard his voice, set out to the Kingdom of Naples. He died that year at Aquila, in the Abruzzi. According to the tradition, his grave continued to leak blood until two factions of the city achieved reconciliation.



Reports of miracles attributed to Bernardino multiplied rapidly and Bernardino was canonized in 1450, only six years after his death, by Pope Nicholas V. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is May 20, day of his death.



Attacks on sodomy.

Bernardino attacked the sodomitical customs of the Italians in his sermons, among which one pointing out the reputation of the Italians beyond their own borders: 

O Italia, quanto ne se' contaminata più che altra provincia ! Va' a tedeschi, e ode che bello vanto e' danno a' Taliani! Dicono che non è generazione al mondo, che sieno maggiori sodomitti che Italiani.

which can be translated as: ""O, Italy, how much more than any other province have you become contaminated! Go to the Germans, and hear what lovely things they say about the Italians! They say there is no people in this world that are greater sodomites than the Italians."" (""Abominabile peccato della maladetta soddomia"". Prediche volgari sul campo di Siena. 1427 vol. 2, Milan, p. 1149). The practices had been blamed for ""divine"" misfortunes, like the plague, and some in the clergy hoped that catastrophes could be averted by restricting practices they blamed as immoral.





Work for the Order and the spreading of the Observants.

Bernardino laboured strenuously to spread the Observant branch of the Friars Minor from the outset of his religious life: but, contrary to what is sometimes stated, he was not its founder. (The origin of the Observants, or Zelanti, may be traced back to the middle of the fourteenth century.) Nevertheless, Bernardine became to the Observants what St. Bernard had been to the Cistercians, their principal support and indefatigable propagator. Some idea of his zeal may be gathered from the fact that, instead of the one hundred and thirty Friars constituting the Observance in Italy at Bernardino 's reception into the order, it counted over four thousand before his death. 



In addition to the number he received into the order, Bernardino himself founded, or reformed, at least three hundred convents of Friars. Not content with extending his religious family at home, Bernardino sent missionaries to different parts of the Orient and it was largely through his efforts that so many ambassadors from different schismatical nations attended the Council of Florence in which we find the saint addressing the assembled Fathers in Greek. 



Iconography.

After his death, the Franciscans promoted an iconographical program of diffusion of images of Bernardino, which was second only to that of the founder of the order. He is typically represented in painting with three mitres at his feet (representing the three bishoprics which he had rejected) and holding in his hand the IHS monogram with rays emanating from it (representing his devotion to the ""Holy Name of Jesus""). 



A portrait is known to have circulated in Siena just after Bernardino s death which, on the basis of physiognomic similarities with his death mask at L'Aquila (the bald head and emaciated face), is believed to have been a good likeness. It is thought probable that many subsequent depictions of the saint derive from this portrait.



The most famous, and perhaps most highly appreciated, depictions of Bernardino are found in the cycle of frescoes of his life executed towards the end of the fifteenth century by Pinturicchio in the Bufalini Chapel of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, Rome.



Patron.

Saint Bernardino is the patron saint of advertising, communications, compulsive gambling, respiratory problems, the city Carpi (Italy), and the diocese of San Bernardino, California.



Legacy.

In the 15th century, the Catholic Church began to respond to the pressures both of the multiple heresies that had spread throughout southern France and northern Italy and the challenge of Protestantism. As Martin Luther emphasized the direct participation of the laity in the divine and the importance of the sermon, the monastic orders, in particular, reformed. Instead of remaining cloistered and speaking only the liturgy, some, like Bernardino of Siena, attempted to preach directly to the public. The effect was both to stem the inroads of Protestant evangelism and to make the populace more aware of orthodox dogma. The first edition of his works, for the most part elaborate sermons, was printed at Lyon in 1501.

Walter was Judge Dredd's house robot. He is usually used in stories to provide comic relief, and he has a speech impediment which causes him to pronounce his r's as w's. He was made a free robot with the rights of a human citizen in 2099 for his loyal services during the First Robot War. However he was so devoted to Dredd that he chose to remain in Dredd's employ, until he sustained serious damage at the hands of Mean Machine Angel. This was an effort by the writers to kill him off when Judge Dredd stories were becoming grittier and more mature. However, the character was brought back by John Wagner several years later.



In 2116 Walter attempted to lead a second Robot War, and actually shot Dredd to punish him for Dredd's harsh treatment of him over the years. Arrested by Rookie Judge Giant and sentenced to thirty years, he was paroled by Dredd in 2122 and now lives with Mrs Gunderson.



Appearances.



As well as numerous appearances in Judge Dredd, in 1978 Walter had his own eponymous comedy series (one-page episodes), in 2000 AD progs 50-61, 67-68, and 84-85.

58088,Sakhalin,"Sakhalin (, ; Japanese:  or ); Chinese:   ; also Saghalien, is a large elongated island in the North Pacific, lying between 45°50' and 54°24' N.  It is part of Russia and is its largest island, administered as part of Sakhalin Oblast.  Southern Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, and northern Japan were the indigenous lands of the Ainu peoples before they were displaced by force.



The European names derived from misinterpretation of a Manchu name sahaliyan ula angga hada (peak of the mouth of Amur River). Sahaliyan means black in Manchu and refers to Amur River (sahaliyan ula).  Its Japanese name, Karafuto () comes from Ainu Kamuy-Kara-Puto-Ya-Mosir (Kara Puto), which means ""God of mouth of water land"".  The name was restored to the island by the Japanese during their possession of its southern part (1905-1945).



History.

Sakhalin was inhabited in the Neolithic Stone Age. Flint implements, like those found in Siberia, have been found at Dui and Kusunai in great numbers, as well as polished stone hatchets, like European examples, primitive pottery with decorations like those of the Olonets, and stone weights for nets.  Afterwards a population to whom bronze was known left traces in earthen walls and kitchen-middens on the Aniva Bay.



Among the indigenous people of Sakhalin are the Ainu and the Nivkh, as well as others.  Chinese chronicled the Xianbei and Hezhe tribes, who had a way of life based on fishing.  The Chinese in the Ming dynasty knew the island as Kuyi (), and later as Kuye ().  For a short period (1409-1435) Kuye was under the administration of  set up by the Ming dynasty and a Ming boundary stone still exists on the island.  According to Wei Yuan's work Military history of the Qing Dynasty (), the Later Jin sent 400 troops to Sakhalin in 1616, after a newfound interest because of northern Japanese contacts with the area, but later withdrew as it was considered there was no threat from the island.



A Japanese settlement in the southern end of Sakhalin of Ootomari was established in 1679 in a colonialization attempt.  Cartographers of the Matsumae clan created a map of the island and called it ""Kita-Ezo"" (Northern Ezo, Ezo is the old name of Hokkaid ).  The 1686 Nerchinsk Treaty between Russia and China, which defined the Stanovoy Mountains as the border, made no explicit mention of the island.  Nevertheless Russia started occupying the island, with an army made up of convicts, from the 18th century onwards.  The Qing Empire also claimed sovereignty over the island.  However, as the Chinese governments did not have a military presence on the island, people from both Japan and Russia attempted to colonise the island, albeit from different ends.



Sakhalin became known to Europeans from the travels of Ivan Moskvitin and Martin Gerritz de Vries in the 17th century, and still better from those of Jean-François de La Pérouse (1787) and Ivan Krusenstern (1805).  Both, however, regarded it as a peninsula, and were unaware of the existence of the Mamiya Strait or Strait of Tartary, which was discovered in 1809 by Mamiya Rinzo.



On the basis of it being an extension of Hokkaid , geographically and culturally, Japan unilaterally proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island in 1845, as well as the Kuril Islands, as there were competing claims from Russia.  However, the Russian navigator Gennady Nevelskoy in 1849 definitively recorded the existence and navigability of this strait and - in defiance of the Qing and Japanese claims; Russian settlers established coal mines, administration facilities, schools, prisons, churches on the island.  



In 1855, Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Shimoda, which declared that both nationals could inhabit the island: Russians in the north, and Japanese in the south, without a clear boundary between.  Russia also agreed to dismantle its military base at Ootomari.  Following the Opium War, Russia forced the Qing to sign the unequal Treaty of Aigun and Convention of Peking, under which China lost claim to all territories north of Heilongjiang (Amur) and east of Ussuri, including Sakhalin, to Russia.   A katorga (penal colony) was established by Russia on Sakhalin in 1857, but the southern part of the island was held by the Japanese until the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, when they ceded it to Russia in exchange for the Kuril Islands.  After the Russo-Japanese War, Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Portsmouth of 1905, which resulted in the southern part of the island below 50° N reverting to Japan; the Russians retained the other three-fifths of the area.  South Sakhalin was administrated by Japan as Karafuto-ch  (   ), with the capital Toyohara, today's Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and had quite a large number of migrants from Japan and Korea.



In August 1945, according to Yalta Conference agreements, the Soviet Union took over the control of Sakhalin.  The Soviet attack on South Sakhalin started on 11 August 1945, as a part of Operation August Storm, four days before the Surrender of Japan, after the bombing of Hiroshima.  The 56th Rifle Corps consisting of the 79th Rifle Division, the 2nd Rifle Brigade, the 5th Rifle Brigade and the 214 Armored Brigade attacked the Japanese 88th Division.  Although the Red Army outnumbered the Japanese by a factor of three, they were unable to advance due to strong Japanese resistance.  (Japan had quite a presence here, and developed much infrastructure.)  It was not until the 113th Rifle Brigade and the 365th Independent Naval Infantry Rifle Battalion from Sovietskaya Gavan (                ) landed on T r  ( "" ), a seashore village of western Sakhalin on 16 August, that the Soviets broke the Japanese defence line.  Japanese resistance grew weaker after this landing.  Actual fighting, mostly petty skirmishes, continued until 21 August.  From 22 August to 23 August, most of the remaining Japanese units announced a truce.  The Soviets completed the conquest of Sakhalin on 25 August 1945 by occupying the capital, Toyohara.  Japanese sources claim that 20,000 civilians were killed during the invasion.



No final peace treaty has been signed and the status of four neighbouring islands remains disputed.  Japan renounced its claims of sovereignty over southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in the Treaty of San Francisco (1951), but claims that four islands currently administered by Russia were not subject to this renunciation.  However, Japan has granted mutual exchange visas for Japanese and Ainu families divided due to Russian occupation.  Recently, economic and political cooperation has gradually improved between the two nations in spite of it.



Korean Air Flight 007, a South Korean civilian airliner, flew over Sakhalin and was shot down just west of the island by the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983, killing all 269 passengers and crew.



On May 28 1995, an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale occurred, killing 2,000 people in the town of Neftegorsk.



Geography.

Sakhalin is separated from the mainland by the narrow and shallow Mamiya Strait or Strait of Tartary, which often freezes in winter in its narrower part, and from Hokkaid  (Japan) by the Soya Strait or Strait of La Pérouse. Sakhalin is the largest island of Russia, being 948 km (589 miles) long, and 25 to 170 km (16 to 105 miles) wide, with an area of 78,000 km² (30,100 mi²).



Its orography and geological structure are imperfectly known. Nearly two-thirds of Sakhalin is mountainous. Two parallel ranges of mountains traverse it from north to south, reaching 600 1500 m (2000 5000 ft). The Western Sakhalin Mountains peak in Mount Ichara, 1481 m (4860 ft), while the Eastern Sakhalin Mountains's highest peak is Mount Lopatin 1609 m (5279 ft) is also the island's highest mountain. Tym-Poronaiskaya Valley separates the two ranges. Susuanaisky and Tonino-Anivsky ranges traverse the island in the south, while the swampy Northern-Sakhalin plain occupies most of its north.



Crystalline rocks crop out at several capes; Cretaceous limestones, containing an abundant and specific fauna of gigantic ammonites, occur at Dui on the west coast, and Tertiary conglomerates, sandstones, marls and clays, folded by subsequent upheavals, in many parts of the island. The clays, which contain layers of good coal and an abundant fossil vegetation, show that during the Miocene period Sakhalin formed part of a continent which comprised north Asia, Alaska and Japan, and enjoyed a comparatively warm climate. The Pliocene deposits contain a mollusc fauna more arctic than that which exists at the present time, indicating probably that the connection between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans was broader than it is now.



Main rivers: the Tym, 400 km (250 miles) long and navigable by rafts and light boats for 80 km (50 miles), flows north and north-east with numerous rapids and shallows, and enters the Sea of Okhotsk. The Poronai flows south-south-east to the Gulf of Patience or Shichiro Bay, on the south-east coast. Three other small streams enter the wide semicircular Gulf of Aniva or Higashifushimi Bay at the southern extremity of the island.



Demographics.

At the beginning of the 20th century, some 32,000 Russians (of whom over 22,150 were convicts) inhabited Sakhalin along with several thousand native inhabitants. The island's population has grown to 673,100 today, 83 percent of whom are ethnic Russians and followed by Koreans at about 30,000 (5.5%). The native inhabitants consist of some 2,000 Nivkhs, 750 Oroks, 200 Evenks and some Yakuts. The Nivkhs in the north support themselves by fishing and hunting.



The capital Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, a city of about 200,000, has a large Korean minority, typically referred to as Sakhalin Koreans, who were forcibly brought by the Japanese during World War II to work in the coal mines. Most of the population lives in the southern half of the island, centered mainly around Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and two ports, Kholmsk and Korsakov (population 50,000 each).



The 400,000 Japanese inhabitants of Sakhalin were deported following the conquest of the southern portion of the island by the Soviet Union in 1945 at the end of World War II.



Climate.

Owing to the influence of the raw, foggy Sea of Okhotsk, the climate is very cold. At Dui the average yearly temperature is only 0.5 °C (January -15.9 °C; July 16.1 °C), 1.7 °C at Kusunai and 3.1 °C at Aniva (January,  12.5 °C; July, 15.7 °C). At Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky near Dui the annual range is from 27 °C in July to  39 °C in January, while at Rykovsk in the interior the minimum is  45 °C. The rainfall averages 570 mm. Thick clouds for the most part shut out the sun; while the cold current from the Sea of Okhotsk, aided by north-east winds, brings immense ice-floes to the east coast in summer.



Flora and fauna.

The whole of the island is covered with dense forests, mostly coniferous. The Yezo (or Yeddo) spruce (Picea jezoensis), the Sakhalin fir (Abies sachalinsis) and the Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii) are the chief trees; on the upper parts of the mountains are the Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) and the Kurile bamboo (Arundinaria kurilei). Birches, both Siberian silver birch (Betula platyphylla) and Erman's birch (B. ermanii), poplar, elm, Bird cherry (Prunus padus), Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata) and several willows are mixed with the conifers; while farther south the maple, rowan and oak, as also the Japanese Panax ricinifolium, the Amur cork tree (Phellodendron amurense), the Spindle (Euonymus macropterus) and the vine (Vitis thunbergii) make their appearance. The underwoods abound in berry-bearing plants (e.g. cloudberry, cranberry, crowberry, red whortleberry), Red-berried elder (Sambucus racemosa), wild raspberry and Spiraea.



Bears, foxes, otters and sables are numerous, as also the reindeer in the north, and the musk deer, hares, squirrels, rats and mice everywhere. The bird fauna is mostly the common east Siberian, but there are some endemic or near-endemic breeding species, notably the endangered Spotted Greenshank (Tringa guttifer) and the Sakhalin Leaf Warbler (Phylloscopus borealoides). The rivers swarm with fish, especially species of salmon (Oncorhynchus). Numerous whales visit the sea-coast.



Transport.

Transport, especially by sea, is an important segment of the economy. Nearly all the cargo arriving for Sakhalin (and the Kuril Islands) is delivered by cargo boats, or by ferries, in railway wagons, through a sea ferry passage at Vanino-Kholmsk. The ports of Korsakov and Kholmsk are the largest and handle all kinds of goods, while coal and timber shipments often go through other ports. In 1999, a ferry service was opened between the ports of Korsakov and Wakkanai, Japan.



About 30% of all inland transport volume is realized through railways. Sakhalin has railway lines stretching from Nogliki in the north to Korsakov in the south. There is also a departmental narrow-gauge line at Nogliki-Okha, extending 228 km. With the existence of a ferry serving Vanino-Kholmsk, Sakhalin has railway connection with the railway network of the rest of Russia.



Sakhalin is connected by regular flights to Moscow, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and other cities of Russia. The airport of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk has regularly scheduled international flights to Hakodate, Japan and Seoul and Busan, Korea. There are also charter flights to the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Niigata, and Sapporo and the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Dalian, and Harbin.  The city was formerly served by Alaska Airlines from Anchorage, Petropavlovsk and Magadan.



The idea of building a fixed link between Sakhalin and the Russian mainland was first mooted in the 1930s.  In the 1940s, an abortive attempt was made to link the island via a 10 km long undersea tunnel.  The workers supposedly made it almost to the half-way point before the project was abandoned under Nikita Khrushchev.  In 2000, the Russian government revived the idea, adding a suggestion that a 40 km long bridge could be constructed between Sakhalin and the Japanese island of Hokkaid , providing Japan with a direct connection to the Euro-Asian railway network.  It was claimed that construction work could begin as early as 2001.  The idea was received skeptically by the Japanese government and appears to have been shelved, probably permanently, after the cost was estimated at as much as US$50 billion.



Economy.

Sakhalin is a classic ""resource economy"" relying on oil and gas exports, coal mining, forestry, and fishing. There are also some coal deposits and limited quantities of rye, wheat, oats, barley and vegetables are grown, although the growing season averages less than 100 days.



Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and economic liberalization, Sakhalin has experienced an oil  with extensive petroleum exploration and mining by most large oil multinationals. The oil and natural gas reserves contain an estimated 14 billion barrels (2.2 km³) of oil and 96 trillion cubic feet (2,700 km³) of gas and are being developed under production-sharing agreement contracts involving international oil comapnies like ExxonMobil and Shell.



In 1996, two large consortiums signed contracts (pipeline lock-ins) to explore for oil and gas off the northeast coast of the island, Sakhalin-I and Sakhalin-II. The two consortia were estimated to spend a combined $21 billion U.S. dollars on the two projects which almost doubled to $37 billion as of September 2006, triggering Russian governmental opposition. This will include an estimated $1 billion (US) to upgrade the islands infrastructure: roads, bridges, waste management sites, airports, railways, communications systems, and ports. In addition, Sakhalin-III-through-VI are in various early stages of development.



The Sakhalin I project, managed by Exxon Neftgas Limited (ENL), completed a production-sharing agreement (PSA) between the Sakhalin I consortium, the Russian Federation, and the Sakhalin government. Russia is in the process of building a 136 mile (219 km) pipeline across the Tatar Strait from Sakhalin Island to De-Kastri on the Russian mainland. From De-Kastri it will be loaded onto tankers for transport to East Asian markets, namely Japan, South Korea, and China.



The second consortium, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Sakhalin Energy) is managing the Sakhalin II project. They completed the first ever production-sharing agreement (PSA) with the Russian Federation. Sakhalin Energy will build two 800 km pipelines running from the northeast of the island to Prigorodnoye (Prigorodnoe) in Aniva Bay at the southern end. The consortium will also build, at Prigorodnoye, the first ever liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant to be built in Russia. The oil and gas is also bound for East Asian markets. 



Sakhalin II has come under fire from environmental groups, namely Sakhalin Environment Watch, for dumping dredging material in Aniva Bay. The groups were also worried about the offshore pipelines interfering with the migration of whales off the island. The consortium has (as of Jan 2006) re-routed the pipeline to avoid the whale migration.  After a doubling in the projected cost, the Russian government threatened to halt the project for environmental reasons.  There have been suggestions that the Russian government is using the environmental issues as a pretext for obtaining a greater share of revenues from the project and/or forcing involvement by the state-controlled Gazprom. The cost overruns (at least partly due to Shell's response to environmental concerns), are reducing the share of profits flowing to the Russian treasury. 



In 2000, the oil and gas industry accounted for 57.5% of Sakhalin's industrial output.  By 2006, it is expected to account for 80% of the island's industrial output.  Sakhalin's economy is growing rapidly thanks to its oil and gas industry.  By 2005, the island had become the largest recipient of foreign investment in Russia, followed by Moscow.  Unemployment in 2002 was only 2%.  However, all of the oil and gas is for export and none is available to the island's population.

The village is located along the East Coast Highway and is about 20 miles from Georgetown and about 4 miles from Mahaica. It also consists of the village of Bee Hive.



 Demographics .

Historically, Clonbrook was almost 100% Indo-Guyanese, but today, that has changed due to migration within the country.  The village of Clonbrook has a population of about 1,000 and most residents are of Indian Descent (Indo-Guyanese), however in recent years substantial Black migration has occurred.  As a result of migration, many new houses have been constructed near the Public Road, also known as the East Coast Highway.  Like many other Guyanese villages, Clonbrook is somewhat ethnically segregated:  Some sections have a black majority, while others have an Indian majority.  This village is well known for having friendly people, and racial disturbances do not occur.



 Education .

Clonbrook has one school.  However, during the 1960s and 1970s many residents did not take their education seriously, resulting in a literacy rate of only 84%, below the national average of 98%. (Source: Random Survey of 100 random people conducted in 2005).

1145922,Washington Crossing the Delaware,"This article is about the painting.  For the poem, see Washington Crossing the Delaware (sonnet).;





Washington Crossing the Delaware is an 1851 oil-on-canvas painting by Emanuel Leutze. It is in commemoration of Washington's crossing of the Delaware on December 25, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, the first move in a surprise attack against the Hessian forces at Trenton, New Jersey in the Battle of Trenton. 



As of 2004, it is part of the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.



History.

German-born Emanuel Leutze grew up in America, then returned to Germany as an adult, where he conceived of the idea for this painting during the Revolutions of 1848. Hoping to encourage Europe's liberal reformers through the example of the American Revolution, and using American tourists and art students as models and assistants, Leutze finished the first painting in 1850. Just after it was completed, the first version was damaged by fire in his studio, subsequently restored, and acquired by the Kunsthalle Bremen. In 1942, during the Second World War, it was destroyed in a bombing raid by the British Royal Air Force (which has led to a persistent joke that the raid was Britain's final retaliation for the American Revolution).



The second painting, a full-sized copy of the first, was begun in 1850 and placed on exhibition in New York in October 1851. More than 50,000 people viewed it, including an 8-year-old Henry James, who later recalled that he ""gaped responsive at every item"" in ""the epoch-making masterpiece."" It was originally bought by Marshall O. Roberts for $10,000 (at the time, an enormous sum). After changing ownership several times, it was finally donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1897. It remains on exhibition there as of 2007.



In January 2003, the painting was defaced when a former Metropolitan Museum of Art guard glued a picture of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to it. No permanent damage was caused. 



Another duplicate painting or an exact replica hangs in the lobby of the West Wing of the White House.



Composition.





The painting is notable for its artistic composition. Washington is emphasized by an unnaturally bright sky, while his face catches the upcoming sun. The colors consist of mostly dark tones, as is to be expected at dawn, but there are red highlights repeated throughout the painting. Foreshortening, perspective and the distant boats all lend depth to the painting and emphasize the boat carrying Washington.



The people in the boat represent a cross-section of the American colonies, including a man in a Scottish bonnet and a man of African descent facing backward next to each other in the front, western riflemen at the bow and stern, two farmers in broad-brimmed hats near the back (one with bandaged head), and an androgynous rower in a red shirt, possibly meant to be a woman in man's clothing.



The man standing next to Washington and holding the flag is Lieutenant James Monroe, future President of the United States.



Historical inaccuracy.

The painting contains an often-discussed historical inaccuracy: the flag borne in the painting is an anachronism.



The flag depicted is the original flag of the United States (the ""Stars and Stripes"") of which the design did not exist at the time of Washington's crossing. The flag's design was specified in the June 14, 1777 Flag Resolution of the Second Continental Congress, and flew for the first time on September 3, 1777 well after Washington's crossing in 1776. The historically accurate flag would have been the Grand Union Flag, officially hoisted by Washington himself on January 2, 1776 at Cambridge, Massachusetts, as the standard of the Continental Army and the first national flag.



Artistic concerns motivated further deviations from historical (and physical) accuracy.  For example, the boat (of the wrong model) looks too small to carry all occupants and stay afloat, but this emphasizes the struggle of the rowing soldiers. There are phantom light sources besides the upcoming sun, as can be seen on the face of the front rower and shadows on the water, to add depth. The crossing took place in the dead of night, so there ought to have been no natural light at all, but this would have made for a very different painting. The river is modeled after the Rhine, where ice tends to form in crags as pictured, not in broad sheets as is more common on the Delaware. (However, some believe the Delaware river really was frozen over as depicted because of a small ice age that was occurring at the time.) Finally, Washington's stance, obviously intended to depict him in a heroic fashion, would have been very hard to maintain in the stormy conditions of the crossing.  Debunkers of the painting's historical accuracy have traditionally said that Washington would have been sitting down; historian David Hackett Fischer has argued, however, that everyone would have been standing up to avoid the icy water in the bottom of the boat (the actual boats used had higher sides).



Related artistic works.

Washington Crossing the Delaware (sonnet) is also the title of a 1936 sonnet by David Schulman. It refers to the scene in the painting, and is a 14-line rhyming sonnet of which every line is an anagram of the title.

History of the club.

Club was founded in May, 1930 and its name before 1953 was Tractor.

Almost every fan knows that the first game of Rostselmash in championship was in 1953 but very few people know how the club had reached the USSR championship.



The club, named Traktor, started in RSFSR's championship in 1950 and played there for 3 seasons.



1950 Club started in championship of RSFSR in South zone of Azov-Don group. The first match was played on May 28th, the last   on September 10th. This season was unlucky for the team, which only in 9th place (out of 10).



1951 The championship's rules were changed. In the RSFSR's championship 100 clubs had to play in 8 zones, each divided into 2 groups A and B. Traktor started in group B. By the end of the season it was in first place. The next year Traktor was to play in the group A, where the leader was Dynamo from Rostov.



1952 Traktor was the third in its group, which was led by Dynamo from Rostov and Krasnodar. Next season team started in USSR championship.



Championships of USSR



1953 Club started as Traktor in Class B of USSR championship. In June it got the new name - Torpedo.



The first match was played on May 2nd vs Dynamo from Alma-Ata. It was the first victory - 2:1, Kruglov scored 2 goals.



1958 Club renamed to Rostselmash.

The club played in Class B until 1964. That year Rostselmash was first out of 16 in its zone. Then it played in semi-final of zone winners of RSFSR's Class B, where it came in second. And in the final round it was the first by playing the additional match for the first place against Terek Grozny. Rostselmash won that match 2:0 (Yakovenko scored 2). Next season Rostselmash started in the second group of Class A.



1965 Rostselmash played in the 2nd group of the class A for the first time and the season was unlucky. Rostov club finished it in the last, 32nd place. Only because the number of teams for the next season in group had been increased Rostselmash stayed in the class A.



In 1966 some new players were introduced to the club. By the end of the season Rostselmash was in 11th place (out of 17).



1970-1974 During these years Rostselmash did not take part in the USSR championship. It only played in regional tournaments.



1975 After a break Rostselmash returned to USSR championship, which had changed its format. Club started in the 3rd zone of the 2nd League (third highest level). After the first half of the season Rostselmash was in the 3rd place. But by the end of the championship it was in 8th place.



1985 Since the middle of 70's Rostselmash's target was to get into the first league. The club was ready to enter this league - it had had own stadium, own sport-school. The gigantic plant with the same name as the club helped the team. Rostselmash had long traditions - Viktor Ponedelnik, master of the sport, played for Rostselmash. Well-known football players graduated from Rostselmash's sport school, among them Gennadi Matveev, Aleksandr Shevchenko, Veniamin Iskra, Enver Yulgushov, Eduard Yakovenko, Andrian Zhila, Viktor Odintsov, and, in the generation before them, Aleksei Grigoryev, Aleksandr Kazakov, Nikolai Kireyev etc. However, during the next ten years Rostselmash could not reach this target. In some years, the club fell only one point short of reaching the first league.



Rostselmash was the leader in the 3rd zone of the 2nd league, but always came second. The secret is that it was the most powerful zone in the 2nd League. The clubs that are well-known today played in that zone - Rotor Volgograd, Spartak Ordzhonikidze (now Alaniya), Dynamo Stavropol. It was a surprise when Rostselmash won the zone in 1985, nobody had believed they could do it before the season. The main leaders were Terek Grozny and Sokol Saratov. These teams had good players and they represented rich provinces. In the first half of the championship these teams were defeated by Rostselmash, which played away matches. Especially surprising result was in Grozny, where Terek was know for its defence. Rostselmash won that match 5:0.



Rostselmash has gained momentum that year which they did not lose for the whole championship. They went for 26 straight games without a loss. Only in the end of the championship Rostselmash lost the match against Druzhba in Maykop.



The winning of the zone wasn't enough to get into the first league. The tournament of the zone's winners was ahead. The draw was the worst that one can imagine. The opponents were Tavriya from Simferopol - winner of the Ukraine group, the strongest one; Zvezda from Dzhizak - the club which has already played in the first league for several seasons; the winner of the Middle-Asian zone, Sohibkor from Halkabad. Two clubs from Uzbekistan could stand shoulder to shoulder.



The key to success of winning this tournament was first match of Rostselmash vs Zvezda. Not only the result was surprising - Rostselmash had won that match 5:0 - but also the club's game: the players were confident of themselves, in great shape and great athleticism. The next step in the tournament was like the first. Rostselmash had won 5 matches of 6 and got into the first league.



Head coach of Rostselmash V. N. Sinau said after all that: ""There were no problems as far as players shape and athleticism go. The players are professionals with good quallification. The most important thing was to let them forget about always coming in second place. We repeated to them almost every day: Enough sight-seeing in the North Caucasus. It is time to fight against more serious clubs such as like Pamir & SKA, Karpati, Nistru & Daugava, Lokomotiv & CSKA.""



Rostselmash was a club of attack. This tactic played a great role not only in home but also in away matches in spite of the defence of the opponent.



The first league of USSR championship.



1986 The debut of Rostselmash in the first league was successful. The club has been preparing for this in the second league for 11 years. Rostselmash also had some new players transferred from SKA Rostov-na-Donu, who had previously played in the premier league, and that helped as well.



Rostselmash was in the 7th place and scored 86 goals. That was the most goals scored in the league. If the club scored three goals more, then it would have beaten the record set in 1979 by Karpati Lvov. Next few seasons were like running in place. Some leading players left the team, head coach was replaced in 1990.



And then year 1991



It was the best season of Rostselmash in USSR championship. The club was in the 4th place. In home matches Rostselmash had no losses and conceded only 5 goals. Rostselmash fought bravely for promotion almost until the very end of the season. That was the last season of USSR championship. The last club's goal in the Soviet period of history was scored on November 5, 1991 by Aleksandr Usaty in Riga, Latvia where Rostselmash defeated Pardaugava 3-0. Three days later, on November 8, the club's last Soviet game was played in St. Petesburg, where Rostselmash, represented with its second team, lost 0-6 to Zenit.



Russian Championships



So, year 1992 The first Russian championship began on March 29th, 1992. Rostselmash was included in group B together with Spartak and Torpedo from Moscow; these clubs had won silver and bronze medals of the last USSR championship; Rotor from Volgograd, the winner of the first league; Asmaral Moscow, managed by the famous coach Konstantin Beskov; Lokomotiv from Nizhny Novgorod, always hard to play against. Most of Rostselmash's home matches were played at the SKA staium. The club's stadium was being reconstructed, and matches could not have been held at it until autumn. Because of that, Rostselmash has played only the last four home games of the season at its native stadium. Among the games played at SKA was the first match of the season played against Shinnik Yaroslavl. That game was not only the first game for Rostselmash but also the first game of all Russian championships, because of the earlier kick-off time compared to the other cities - 3 pm. The goal which had been scored on the 27th minute of the match by Aleksandr Tikhonov became the first Russian championships goal. That match was the first which Rostselmash had won in the highest league - 2:0. The championship that year was played in two stages - first in 2 groups of 8 teams, and then again in 2 groups of 8 teams (four best from each of the groups from the first stage playing against each other and four worst from the first stage), Rostselmash took 8th place, it would only be higher than that in 1998 and 1999.



1993 This season was the worst for Rostselmash in all of its Russian history. One of the reasons was that there had not been enough good players. During the first half of the season several players left the club - Klyuchnikov went to Finland, Balakhnin and Styopushkin went to Israel, Kovtun left for the Dynamo Moscow. The best forward A. Tikhonov was injured. It was impossible to find players who could replace them. But in the second half Andreyev, Parovin and Tatarkin returned and helped the club.

For the first 11 games of the second half Rostselmash was on the same level as its opponents, but the most important matches were the two last games of the championship in Moscow against Spartak and Dynamo. Rostselmash did not take any points in those matches. Rostselmash and Ocean had the same number of points, but Rostov club had fewer wins. So, it had to start in the first league for the next year.



1994 History was told by the head coach of Rostselmash of 1994 Enver Yulgushov.



What was hard in the season? When in spring we were gathering information about our opponents we had not believed in our success. Zenit from St. Petesburg was the main club which had been counted as one of two teams to win this championship. Besides, Chernomorets from Novorossiisk   with Oleg Dolmatov as head coach   was showing good footbal and have already knocked at the door of the highest league. The good team was in Saratov   Sokol. Also Asmaral from Moscow, Luch and Ocean from Far East. Baltika, which was one of the pretenders on the highest league during season, had not been counted such before season.

We had a lot of losts in the club. But the main loss was our goalkeeper Evgeny Krukov, who had helped a lot. We did not wait for that he would choose another club. We were searching for another good goalkeeper until the second round. Then we baught Evgeny Kurnukhin. We had one more problem. Football championship is not only the competition of the clubs but also of the biggest cities. Two port-cities were standing for Chernomorets and Baltika, the aviation gigantiv plant was standing for Saratov. Our samenamed plant Rostselmash refused to help us because of the own problems.

The club had reached its target. The monument should be put on the stadium to the players. The fought in spite of all problems. We had no pessimists in the team. The main slogan was: Football   first of all, other things would be later. I think it wasn t occasionally that such players as Andrey Redkin, Sergey Dementev, Mikhail Kupriyanov from Moscow, Vitaliy Papadopulo, Alexander Vorobjev had come to our club.

I heard that some people were saing that Rostselmash hadn t wanted to get into the highest league, that in club there had been a lot of old players, who didn t want to play in highest league. But this old playears were the main force to get into the highest league.

During last two seasons Rostselmash fount its game, partners understood each other, the game was with elements of force. This game we shall show next season as our visiting card together with Alexander Maslov, Dmitriy Loskov, Andrey Redkin. But also the old players can make a lot.

We, trainers, had October as double, the 13-th month of the year. The race together with Baltika needed a lot of physics and moral forces. Also we had to think about future. It was clear, the we had to strength two or three points on the playing field. But what players did we need? Did we need players of the first or the highest league? So, the administration of the club had no time for the rest. Thanks to the God, that everything overed successfully   we had reached the tops of the Russian football!



1995



Rostov club had to search for new players again. Nobody afraid of the well-known players in the highest league. Club got new goalkeeper, who had played for the national team of Georgia   Akakiy Devadze. Ulgushov invited three new defenders, who had played in the highest league before. The are Golubkin from Tolyatti he had played in Rostselmash earlier, Eshenko from Volgograd and player of the Spartak Moscoe Ananko club rented him. Sergey Andreev who had been the captain of Rostselmash changed his title for head coach. The club was on the 14-th place of the 16-th. It was with new and young coach.



1996



Alexey Gerasimenko, Gradilenko, Vladislav Prudius have entered the club this year. The season was rather lucky. Alexander Maslov beacme the best forward of the championship.



1997



This season was the year of coming new well-known players. Igor Khankeev, Vladimir Savchenko, Mikhail Kupriyanov and Oleg Pestryakov has entered the club. But the club lost such players as D. Loskov, A. Devadze, Ageev. Durin all the season Rostselmash was in the middle of the championship s table.

In this year Rostselmash was scored the 200 goal. The most beautiful match was in Rostov-na-Donu against Spartak Moscow which Rostselmash had lost 3:5. After the score had been 1:4 it became 3:4. Only on the last minute Spartak scored the 5-th goal.



1998



This season was the best of all Russian championships for Rostselmash. By the end of it the club had been on the 6-th place. And also were new players   Sergey Kolotovkin, Anatoliy Bessmertniy, Dmitriy Kirichenko. Alexey Gerasimenko have left Rostselmash for Dynamo Kiev. The first time of all its history Rostselmash got the right to play in Euro Cups   for beginning in Intertoto Cup.



1999



This season will be remembered for the long time   Rostov-na-Donu has been visited by Juventus Turin, Italy. Rostselmash couldn t defeat this club of corse, but the club had gotten great thanks. For 3 months team played matches on every 3-rd day. Everybody knews such results of playing in Intertoto Cup   Uralmash, Tekstilshik, KamAZ has left the highest division after it. But Rostselmash had been on the 7-th place by the end of the championship only five cluns from Moscow and Alania from Vladikavkaz were ahead. Even Rotor Volgograd and Torpedo Moscow couldn t reach such results after Intertoto Cup.



2000



Only 6 wins, the 12-th position in tournament table and Sergey Andreev s left   this is the result of the season, which brought only regret. FC Rostselmash participated in UEFA Intertoto Cup for the second time and failed to pass through AJ Auxerre from France.



2001



The debut of Sergei Balakhnin wasn t lucky. Anatoly Baydachny, who came on his place, also didn t reach much. The white spot in FC Rostselmash was Dmitry Kirichenko, who scored 13 goals. But he left for PSC CSKA after this season.



2002



The season should be interesting. The administration put the task to get the medals. But the first circle showed than team has a lot of problems. As the result FC Rostselmash got finance and moral crisis. The gubernator of Rostov Region Vladimir Chub advised Ivan Savvidi to lead the club. After change of leaders the situation became better. The club had no more financial problems, got two new strong legionaries, returned Alexandr Maslov to team. Sergei Balakhnin became the head coach again. The result of the season stayed in the league, but wasn t higher than 12 position for the first time during last 3 seasons.



2003



In 2003 club was renamed in honour of its city and got their best achievement in Russia. In Russian Cup they played in the Final, where they played equal with 9-time Russian champion Spartak Moscow. Rostov lost 0-1, but one week later they won in chapionship game vs Spartak 3-2 proved they had the ability to win Cup. On December 9, 2003 Balakhnin was sacked. Vitaliy Shevchenko took his place.



2004



Club started this season with bad results. Rostov lost 0-4 its starting championship match against Torpedo on the home ground. This match was followed by a series of games without a single win. As a result, when on April 14, 2004 Rostov lost 0-3 the Russian Cup game to Torpedo-Metallurg, Shevchenko resigned. Two days later club chairman Ivan Savvidi again appointed Balakhnin as head coach. Club has occupied 12 places showing bad play, what antipathy to rooters. All were not a complacent president a club. On December 30, 2004 Sergey Balakhnin was sacked again and replaced by Gennady Stepushkin, a former Rostselmash defender.



2005



Again, the club's start in the championship was very poor. In the first 5 games, FC Rostov got only one point. On April 18, 2005 the club's official website stated that Stepushkin was ill and would be temporarily replaced with Paul Ashworth, director of sport of the club. In July 2005 Ashworth moved to coach Skonto Riga and was replaced by Valeri Petrakov who coached FC Moskva before that. In the first four games under Petrakov Rostov took only one point, and he was fired and replaced by Sergei Balakhnin, who will have his fourth stint as a head coach of the club. Some days later, Ivan Savvidi also resigned as the president.

In the middle of the season it seemed that nothing could save FC Rostov from relegation, but after these changes the club's performance improved dramatically. The club signed some good players, who, especially striker Maxim Buznikin, helped the club to get 19 points in 11 games and to stay away from relegation. Buznikin, who scored 8 goals in 10 games, was voted player of the year by Rostov supporters.

1046291,Hampden-Sydney College,"Hampden-Sydney College is a liberal arts college for men located in Hampden-Sydney, Virginia.  Founded in 1775, Hampden-Sydney is the 10th oldest college in the United States and one of only four remaining mainstream all-men's liberal arts colleges in the United States (the others are Wabash College, Deep Springs College, and Morehouse College).  



For nearly two and a half centuries, Hampden-Sydney College has been dedicated to the goal of forming  good men and good citizens in an atmosphere of sound learning. 



Overview.



Hampden-Sydney enrolls over 1,100 students from thirty states and several foreign countries.  The College enrolls young men of character and ability who will benefit from a rigorous and traditional liberal arts curriculum.  



The school is one of two remaining traditional all-male colleges. The school's mission is to ""form good men and good citizens."" As such, Hampden-Sydney has one of the strictest Honor Codes of any college or university. Upon entering as a student, each man pledges that he will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do while he is a student at Hampden-Sydney. This simply-worded code of behavior applies to the students lives on or off campus.  Though it is strict, the justice system is student-run, allowing for a true trial of peers, adjudicated by a court that is both thorough and compassionate to both the college and their fellow students.



Every student must prepare for and take the Rhetoric Proficiency Exam, a three-hour essay that is graded upon coherence of argument, quality of argument, style in which the argument is presented, and grammatical correctness.  To prepare, the college requires each student to pass two Rhetoric classes that are usually taken the first two semesters a student is at Hampden-Sydney. After graduating, many alumni have stated that the the Rhetoric Program was the most valuable aspect in the Hampden-Sydney information. Indeed, knowing how to write well makes one invaluable to any workplace or organization.



History.



Classes at Hampden-Sydney began in temporary wooden structures on November 10, 1775, on the eve of the American War of Independence; This makes Hampden-Sydney College the nation's 10th oldest college.  The College has been in continuous operation since that date, and despite the difficult and financially-strapped first years resulting from the Revolutionary War, the College survived with sufficient viability to be granted a charter by the Virginia General Assembly in 1783   the oldest private charter in the South.



Hampden-Sydney College derives its name from John Hampden (1594-1643) and Algernon Sidney (1622-1683).  Hampden lost his life in the battle of Chalgrove Field during the English Civil War.  Sydney, who wrote Discourses Concerning Government, was beheaded by order of Charles II following a failed attempt to overthrow the king.  The college was founded by alumni and people affiliated with Princeton University.  These proponents of religious and civil liberties were much admired by the founders of the College, all of whom were active supporters of the cause of American independence. Both Patrick Henry and James Madison were elected trustees in the founding period before classes began.



The college's founder and first president, Rev. Samuel Stanhope Smith, was subsequently the president of the College of New Jersey, which is currently Princeton University. Smith hired many faculty members from the College of New Jersey.



Hampden-Sydney became a thriving college in southside Virginia. In fact, the college s website states that  In its first fifty years the College prospered and gained the respect of the public and of the educational world.  This led to an expansion of the college. In 1812, the Union Theological Seminary was founded at Hampden-Sydney College. The Seminary was later moved to Richmond, VA and is currently the Union Theological Seminary & Presbyterian School of Christian Education. In 1838, the medical department of Hampden-Sydney College founded the Medical College of Virginia which is now the MCV Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. During this time, the college constructed new buildings using Federal style architecture. This is the style of architecture still used on the campus.



At the onset of the American Civil War, Hampden-Sydney students formed a company in the Virginia Militia. The Hampden-Sydney students did not see much action but rather were  captured, and...paroled by General George B. McClellan on the condition that they return to their studies. 1.



The Campus.

The College has expanded from its original small cluster of buildings on 100 acres (0.4 km²²) to a campus of over 1000 acres (4 km²²). Prior to February 2006, the college owned 660 acres (2.7 km²²). In February 2006, the college purchased 400 acres (1.6 km²²) which include a lake and the historic location of the college s founding. The campus is host to numerous Federal style buildings. Part of the campus has been designated as a National Historic Preservation Zone. The campus has recently undergone major construction and renovation. In 2004 a new Fitness Center was completed in Kirby field house. During the summer of 2005, a new parking lot was constructed behind the alphabet dorms. The original parking lot for the alphabet dorms (directly across College Rd.) was torn out and filled in with dirt and grass. 



As of July 2006, the college s new library was halfway through construction. The new library is expected to be open for the Fall 2007 semester. As of July 2006, the college is also in the middle of construction of a FieldTurf field for the Hampden-Sydney lacrosse team. The field is scheduled to be completed in August 2006.



Lewis C. Everett of Kilmarnock, Virginia, has given Hampden-Sydney College $2.5 million to construct the Lewis C. Everett Stadium. Construction on the 1850-seat facility will begin in November 2006 and will be completed in August 2007. The Everett Stadium will replace the 40-year-old Hundley Stadium adjacent to Fulton Field.



Student life.



Demographics.



According to the Hampden-Sydney College website, the student body for 2004-05 is 94.1 percent White, 2.7 percent Black, 1.0 percent Hispanic, and 1.7 percent Asian.  The majority (63%) of the student body is from Virginia. The rest come from 35 other states and 10 different countries.  



Clubs and organizations.



According to the Hampden-Sydney College website, there are over 40 clubs on campus. Each club is run by the students themselves and the clubs come in a large variety. For example, there are political clubs,  sports clubs, religious clubs, a pep band, and multiple social fraternities. There are also volunteer groups such as the local volunteer fire department. Students can also participate in the various publications as well as WWHS-FM, the student run radio station (www.wwhsfm.org).



Greek Life.



For freshmen rush begins in the first semester and pledging takes place in the spring.  If a freshman chooses not to rush and/or pledge, sophomores and juniors may pledge in the fall or spring.  Roughly 33% of the student body is involved in Greek Life.

4853281,El laberinto,"El Laberinto (Spanish for ""The Labyrinth"") is a 1974 novel by Manuel Mujica Laínez.



It purports to tell the story of ""Ginés de Silva"", the boy shown holding a torch in the lower left-hand corner of El Greco's 1586 painting The Burial of Count Orgaz.



This picaresque Bildungsroman presents, with virtuosic gusto, a rich and highly amusing series of pictures from the boy's Seville childhood in the 1570s to the old man's death in early colonial Argentina in the 1650s. Thus it connects, somehow, its author's Renaissance-preocupied novels (Bomarzo; El unicornio) with which it forms a kind of trilogy, with Mujica Laínez' Buenos Aires cycle.



As usual with Manuel Mujica Laínez, the main love-story in this novel involves a same-sex relationship."

At the time, it was the oldest known pterosaur specimen from the Western Hemisphere. Kevin Padian, who described it, did not assign it to any family or suborder within Pterosauria, but did note that the jugal was unlike that of pterodactyloids, and so may have belonged to a rhamphorhynchoid. A bone from the wing of another pterosaur from the same formation may have also belonged to a rhamphorhynchoid, with a wingspan of about 1.5 m (4.92 ft). Peter Wellnhofer agreed that a rhamphorhynchid identity was very likely, but David Unwin was more hesistant to classify its fragmentary remains in The Pterosaurs: From Deep Time, noting it only as a ""possibly valid species of uncertain relationships.""

He was born in Greymouth, and played rugby first for his school, Christchurch Boys' High School, and then for Canterbury before finally playing for the All Blacks between 1966 and 1968. After retiring from sport due to injury, he took up teaching, first at the Brisbane Boys' College and then back in New Zealand. He eventually became headmaster of Hamilton Boys' High School. In the 1990 elections, he stood for Parliament as a candidate for the National Party, defeating Labour's Bill Dillon in the Hamilton East electorate. In the 1993 elections, however, he was defeated by Labour's Dianne Yates. He regained the seat in the 1996 elections, and retained it in the 1999 elections, but in the 2002 elections, he was defeated again by Dianne Yates. Having opted not to seek a position on National's party list, Steel left Parliament.  Testament to Steel's popularity in the city of Hamilton is the fact that he lost what has traditionally been regarded as a bell-weather seat by a mere 600 votes, in an election where the National Party was almost destroyed by its lowest polling result in recent history."

Primarily selection is for habitats of inherent wildlife interest, but some sites may be selected for

supporting rare or scarce species of plants or animals outside such habitats.

1166888,Michael Rose,"Born in Kingston, Jamaica on July 11, 1957, Michael Rose was fortunate enough to be introduced to music as a teenager by his older brother Joseph. Blessed with an outstanding voice, Michael Rose would regularly meet in Kingston with singers, musicians, writers, and producers such as Dennis Brown, Big Youth, The Wailers, Gregory Isaacs, Sly and Robbie, and others.  With his brothers he sang the hotel circuit.



 Career .



Michael Rose started his recording career as a solo artist for producers Yabby U and Niney The Observer.



He joined Black Uhuru in 1974? after the departure of Don Carlos & Garth Dennis. He led them to international success in the early 1980s, having written most of their popular material. They won the first-ever Grammy Award for Reggae in 1985 for the album ""Anthem"" with the hallmark voice of Michael Rose in the forefront.



After the release of ""Anthem"" Michael left Black Uhuru and retired to the Blue Mountains in Jamaica to start a coffee farm. He released a string of singles in Jamaica, but nothing much was heard of him outside the island until 1989, when he was signed to RCA and released the stringly pop-influenced album ""Proud"" in Europe and Japan. The deal with RCA was short-lived however, and Rose returned to Jamaica to record a new string of Sly & Robbie produced singles. He also recorded for other producers but the only albums during this period were the Japan-only releases ""Bonanza"" (1991) and ""King Of General"" (1992). The Sly & Robbie singles were eventually released on the vinyl-only ""Sly And Robbie presents: Mykall Rose - The Taxi Sessions"" in 1995. 1995 also saw his American debut as a solo artist with the album ""Michael Rose"" on Heartbeat Records. The single ""Short Temper"" reached #2 on the Gavin Reggae Chart.



In the period 1995-2004 Heartbeat Records released a total of 9 albums including ""Party In Session: Live"" and a compilation entitled """". Next to these albums, a great amount of different recordings appeared on dozens of Jamaican vinyl singles and several albums, including ""Last Chance"" which was #1 on the British Reggae charts for several weeks. More often than not, his name was spelled ""Mykal Rose"", ""Mikal Roze"", which Rose has said is the Ethiopian way of spelling his name, which made it feel closer to home. It would also appear that, in general, the music was not released in the order of recording. He also recorded 'Michael rows the boat ashore' in 2001.



In 2002, Rose recorded 2 albums: ""Babylon 9/11 Tip Of The Iceberg"" (released on Love Injection in 2004), and a yet untitled album for African Star records. In August 2002, Rose was reported arrested in Miami Airport by US Marshalls in a case of mistaken identity. Although he was released, it resulted in Rose losing his US work permit.



Rose re-joined Black Uhuru in February 2004, and performed several concerts in Jamaica and Europe with the group. They also released a Jamaican single ""Dollars"" and reportedly have recorded a yet untitled and unreleased album. Yet, in spite of his reunion with Black Uhuru, Michael Rose still tours, records and releases material as a solo artist. Dub producer Ryan Moore (of Twilight Circus) is responsible for the latest album on M Records entitled ""African Roots"" (released June 2005) and its dub companion ""African Dub"" (released November 2005).



His distinct vocal style, his ""tu tu twang"", and other scats, have inspired many singers.

 he is a memeber of the Rastafari movement.

Starkweather was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island to Oliver and Miriam (Clay) Starkweather.  He graduated from Brown College in 1822, tutored there until 1824, and then left to study law in Windham, Connecticut.  Starkweather was admitted to the Ohio Bar Association in Columbus in 1826.  Starkweather moved to Cleveland soon after and joined the Cleveland Grays in 1837, where he took a prominent position in Cleveland politics.  Starkweather was elected mayor in 1844, won reelection in 1845, and again in 1857 for a 2-year term.  He was the first judge of the Cuyahoga Court of Common Pleas elected under the new Constitution and served a 5-year term.  Starkweather helped establish the first high school in Cleveland.  He also promoted railroads in Cleveland and helped establish the Cleveland, Columbus & Cincinnati Railroad.



Starkweather married Julia Judd on June 25, 1828.  Their 4 children were Sarah, Samuel, William, and Julia.  Starkweather is buried in Lake View Cemetery.

8227512,Jose F. Valdez,"Private First Class Jose F. Valdez (January 3, 1925-February 17, 1945)  was a United States Army soldier who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor   the United States' highest military decoration for his actions near Rosenkrantz, France during World War II.



Early years.



Valdez was a Mexican-American born in the born in Governador, New Mexico.  He lived in Utah in the 1940s and upon the outbreak of World War II joined the United States Army at a recruiting station in the Pleasant Grove.  After completing his basic training, he was assigned to the Army's 3rd Infantry Division. 



World War II.



The 3rd Infantry Division, which was under the command of Major General John W. O'Daniel, was stationed in North Africa.  Gen. O'Daniel led the division in battles in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France.  On January 23, 1945, the 3rd Infantry Division began its second offensive against Siegfried Line positions south of Zweibrucken. The Siegfried Line was a defense system stretching more than 630 km (392 miles) with more than 18,000 bunkers, tunnels and tank traps. It went from Kleve on the border with the Netherlands, along the western border of the old German Empire as far as the town of Weil am Rhein on the border to Switzerland.



On January 25, 1945, Valdez was on patrol with 5 of his fellow soldiers in the vicinity of Rosenkrantz, France, when unexpectedly they confronted an enemy counterattack.  An enemy tank was headed towards the patrol and Valdez, upon his own inactive, opened fire against the tank with his automatic rifle, action which made the tank withdrawal.  After Valdez killed 3 enemy soldiers in a firefight, the Germans ordered a full attack and sent in two companies of infantrymen.



Valdez offered to cover the members of his patrol when the platoon leader ordered a withdrawal.  He fired upon the approaching enemy and his patrol members were able to reach American lines.  Valdez was wounded and was able to drag himself back to American lines, however, he soon died from his wounds.        

  

Medal of Honor citation.

Jose F. Valdez

Rank and organization:Private First Class, U.S. Army, Company B, 7th Infantry, 3rd Infantry Division.

Place and date: Near Rosenkrantz, France, 25 January 1945.

Entered service at:Pleasant Grove, Utah. 

Born:Governador, New Mexico

G.O. No.: 16, 8 February 1946.

Citation:

He was on outpost duty with 5 others when the enemy counterattacked with overwhelming strength. From his position near some woods 500 yards beyond the American lines he observed a hostile tank about 75 yards away, and raked it with automatic rifle fire until it withdrew. Soon afterward he saw 3 Germans stealthily approaching through the woods. Scorning cover as the enemy soldiers opened up with heavy automatic weapons fire from a range of 30 yards, he engaged in a fire fight with the attackers until he had killed all 3. The enemy quickly launched an attack with 2 full companies of infantrymen, blasting the patrol with murderous concentrations of automatic and rifle fire and beginning an encircling movement which forced the patrol leader to order a withdrawal. Despite the terrible odds, Pfc. Valdez immediately volunteered to cover the maneuver, and as the patrol 1 by 1 plunged through a hail of bullets toward the American lines, he fired burst after burst into the swarming enemy. Three of his companions were wounded in their dash for safety and he was struck by a bullet that entered his stomach and, passing through his body, emerged from his back. Overcoming agonizing pain, he regained control of himself and resumed his firing position, delivering a protective screen of bullets until all others of the patrol were safe. By field telephone he called for artillery and mortar fire on the Germans and corrected the range until he had shells falling within 50 yards of his position. For 15 minutes he refused to be dislodged by more than 200 of the enemy; then, seeing that the barrage had broken the counter attack, he dragged himself back to his own lines. He died later as a result of his wounds. Through his valiant, intrepid stand and at the cost of his own life, Pfc. Valdez made it possible for his comrades to escape, and was directly responsible for repulsing an attack by vastly superior enemy forces

Valdez was buried with full military honors in the Santa Fe National Cemetery located in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The government honored the memory of Valdez by naming a technical research ship the USNS Pvt Jose F Valdez (T-AG-169).

4918000,Poppin Ya Collar,"""Poppin' ya collar"" (also ""pop ya collar""), is a phrase generally used in the hip hop lexicon.  It describes not only an action, but also a general attitude.  The term was originally used in this sense by the rapper E-40.  When used by E-40, and many other hip hop artists including Three 6 Mafia in their song Poppin My Collar, the term refers to the act of pulling one's collar, or the clothing where one's collar would be (as when wearing a t-shirt), with the thumb and fingertips. One then releases the clothing in varying degrees of flamboyance. Used in this sense, ""poppin' ya collar"" is more about the attitude and message of confidence portrayed in so doing than any clothing style (see upturned collar). E-40 immortalized the term (and the accompanying attitude), in his song Pop Ya Collar from his album Loyalty and Betrayal."
7117208,Taylor Parkes,"Taylor Parkes is a British journalist, born in 1972. He is best known for his music journalism which appeared in Melody Maker from 1993 to 1998, notable for a style which mixed dark humour, especially in bitterly critical pieces, with an intellectual tone, influenced by the likes of Simon Reynolds and Paul Morley.  He took a stand against the more unadventurous Britpop groups of the mid-1990s (which motivated his involvement with the short-lived Romo scene), although somewhat surprisingly, he was for a time largely positive towards Oasis, in stark contrast to his cohort Simon Price.  Parkes was most closely associated with bands he described as ""unafraid of their own intelligence"", including Saint Etienne, Pulp and Manic Street Preachers, and was an occasional champion of the avant-garde, writing favourably about Post-rock.



He also contributed to Ikon, a pop-cultural magazine published briefly in the mid-1990s, and in the 2000s has written for the football magazine When Saturday Comes, as well as Careless Talk Costs Lives and Plan B, both edited by his former Melody Maker colleague Everett True, and the now-defunct music monthly Bang.

Club career.

Talebloo was very impressive in Esteghlal's goal even though he was competing with another national team goalie, Mehdi Rahmati.



He began receiving media attention when he was able to save Ali Daei's spot kick in an IPL match at the beginning of the 2005/06 season. Ever since then he has become the main goalkeeper for Esteghlal and was one of the keys to Esteghlal winning the IPL championship in the 05/06 season.



In August 2006 Talebloo signed a one year contract extension with Esteghlal FC although he had said that he will leave Esteghlal because the directors there had not kept the promises they made to him but he found it hard to part with the club he loves.



International career.

He made his debut for Iran in the Asian Cup 2007 qualifying match against Chinese Taipei.

598739,Rollo Armstrong,"Rollo Armstrong (born in London) is a part of the music producers/remixers team Rollo and Sister Bliss and older brother to Dido, whom he helped to write and produce the multi-million selling albums No Angel and Life For Rent. 

He is also a member of the electronic music group Faithless, which he formed in 1995 with Sister Bliss, Jamie Catto and Maxi Jazz. In the United States, Rollo is most recognized for his production work on singer/songwriter's, Kristine W's debut album, ""Land of The Living.""



A member of Mensa and holder of a philosophy degree, he has achieved many musical accomplishments as a member of groups and solo, using various monikers: Faithless, Rollo Goes ..., Felix, Our Tribe (with Rob Dougan), and Dusted.



In 1991, Rollo founded Cheeky Records and released two records before it folded a year later because of his lack of business knowledge. Champion Records then stepped in to help with funding and advice enabling Cheeky to re-launch in 1994 (it has since been bought out by BMG). In 1992 a mysterious single was issued, named ""Don't You Want Me"" (not to be confused with the 1981 song with the same name by Human League), played in heavy rotation by club DJs around the world, soon becoming a reliable floor filler. The video which corresponded to the track had a fairly  psychedelic feel; it solely consisted of animated graphics whose ""pulsating"" movement was perfectly synchronized to the beat, which made it resemble a scene demo on the classic home computers. At that time, no one had any idea about the man hiding behind the Felix handle. Not until several months later, it was eventually revealed that it was Rollo who had produced this engrossing club classic. Later in 2006, in a BBC Radio 1 interview with Pete Tong Rollo revealed, that he was paid only 300 pounds to do the track.

1653906,Hull-down,"In modern armoured warfare, hull-down is a position taken up by an armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) such that its hull (the main part of the vehicle) is behind a crest or other raised ground, but its turret (or a superstructure or roof-mounted weapon) is exposed.  This allows it to observe and fire upon the ground ahead, while the hull is protected from enemy fire behind hard cover.  A hull-down AFV is said to be in defilade. Taking advantage of hull-down positions is an element of tactical movement.







Turret-down is the position in which the vehicle's crew can observe forward from roof hatches, but the vehicle is completely hidden (usually a few metres farther back from a hull-down position).  This can also apply to vehicles without turrets.



In relatively flat or gently rolling terrain, a hull-down position may be difficult to find.  The actual protecting rise of ground may be hundreds of metres long.  In steep or abrupt terrain cover is usually plentiful, but it may be difficult to find covered positions from which the vehicle's main gun can fire upon terrain ahead (see tank design, below).



In preparing defensive works, a hull-down position can be created or improved by digging shallow ""tank scrapes"".  Tank units usually have one or two tanks with 'dozer' blades attached for this purpose, and some tank models have a built-in blade.  Combat engineering vehicles often accompany armoured vehicles as they manouvere to dig tank scrapes, as they can accomplish the task more quickly.





 Tactical movement .





Crossing a crest or ridge-line is a dangerous manoeuvre for AFVs, as they are particularly exposed to enemy fire while silhouetted against the sky (sky-lined). While cresting a steep slope, the thin armour on the front bottom of a tank's hull (below the thick glacis plate) can be exposed to fire.  After cresting, the thin top armour may be exposed while it moves down the forward slope.  If an antitank gunner has spotted the AFV, he may train his sights on it and wait for an easy shot while it moves forward.



After observing from a hull-down or turret-down position, an armoured vehicle will try to advance while minimizing these risks.  If possible, it will reverse away from a crest, and try to find a route forward through the relative safety of hidden low ground (dead ground).  



If crossing a long crest is unavoidable, the vehicle will first back down and jockey at least 50 metres across the covered back of the slope, before advancing over the crest at high speed.  An enemy gunner will have little time to locate the target, train his sights on it, and take the shot.  If the terrain is hilly enough, the AFV can quickly enter low ground, then advance through it to another hull-down position.



 Mutual support .



Small armoured units (companies or platoons) make use of these tactics in co-ordinated fashion, when contact with the enemy is expected.  Since firing while moving was until recently impossible or relatively ineffective, elements of a unit (platoons, patrols, or individual vehicles) take turns moving and supporting each other from the halt (see overwatch).  This is called mutual support, or fire and movement, related to the infantry tactic of leap-frogging. Co-ordination is accomplished by hand signals or radio messages.  



Lightly-armed reconnaissance elements make much use of covered movement and stealth, while offensive units such as tanks move much more aggressively.  When speed is paramount, modern tanks (which can fire effectively while moving) may dispense with fire and movement, and move all at once.



 Tank design .





Tanks and other fighting vehicles must be able to depress their gun to be able to take advantage of a hull-down position, since a vehicle's hull is usually tilted upwards when it is behind a crest.  A vehicle with a relatively small range of gun depression may have to drive up onto an exposed crest or forward slope to be able to fire on lower ground to the front.



Notably, Soviet and Russian tanks after World War II have very low profiles, but pay for this advantage by having a poor range of gun depression.  Their low turret roof stops the rising gun breech when the muzzle is depressed.  Thus, Soviet tank crews would have a hard time finding a hull-down position from which they could cover much of the terrain by fire.  The typical Soviet tank had a range of elevation of -5 to +15 degrees, about half that of Western tanks with a range of about -10 to +20 degrees.



This disadvantage was deemed acceptable, since Soviet armoured doctrine emphasized the massed attack with local superiority in numbers. Soviet mechanized forces were supposed to spend more time advancing under fire than in defensive hull-down positions. In contrast, NATO tanks would have been at an advantage in ridge-top hull-down positions, attacking top and side armour of advancing Soviet tanks in killing zones where they couldn't fire back directly. 



Soviet doctrine didn't neglect the defence, however. Newer Soviet tank models were equipped with an integral dozer blade, so given time, they could improve a hull-down position. Soviet tactics also emphasis the use of tanks on the defense in the mobile counter attack role, rather than engaging an enemy advance from relatively fixed positions. 



The polar opposite of the Soviet tanks is the defensively-designed Swedish Stridsvagn 103. Built like a high-tech tank destroyer, but serving the role of a tank, this turretless vehicle is made to nearly disappear in a hull-down position.  It has an even lower profile than Soviet MBTs, with a fixed, auto-loaded gun that is nearly flat against the roof.  Its design gets around the Soviet tanks' limitations by tilting the entire tank hull to elevate (and depress) the gun.  The Stridsvagn 103 also has an integral dozer blade, and a second set of rear-facing driver controls for the radio operator, allowing it to withdraw from a hull-down position at full speed.  This radical, specialized design was created for its hypothetical defensive role on roads in a forested country.

2927114,Wilhelmstraße,"The Wilhelmstraße is a street in Berlin, the capital of Germany. Between the mid 19th century and 1945 it was the administrative centre first of the Kingdom of Prussia and then of the unified German state, housing in particular the Reich Chancellery and the Foreign Office. For this reason the term ""the Wilhelmstraße"" was used to signify the German governmental administration as a whole, much as the term ""Whitehall"" is often used to signify the British governmental administration as whole.



The Wilhelmstraße runs south from the Unter den Linden, on a line slightly east of south, until its juncture with Stresemannstraße near the Hallesches Ufer, a distance of about two kilometres. It is crossed (as one heads south) by Behrenstraße, Leipziger Straße and Zimmerstraße, which to the west of the Wilhelmstraße becomes Niederkirchnerstraße (known before World War II as Prinz-Albrecht-Straße).



A street along this line has existed since the early 18th century, and was known as Husarenstraße (Street of the Hussars) until 1740, when it, along with the Friedrichstraße, which runs roughly parallel to the east, were given their current names to commemorate Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, who had done much to develop the area.



Originally a wealthy residential street, with a number of palaces belonging to members of the Prussian royal family, the Wilhelmstraße developed as a government precinct from the mid 19th century. From 1875 the Reich Chancellery building stood at Wilhelmstraße 77. During the years of the Weimar Republic (1919-33), the President of the Republic's official residence was at Wilhelmstraße 73. It was from the balcony of this building that President Paul von Hindenburg watched the torchlight parade on the night the Nazis came to power in January 1933.



In 1939 a new Reich Chancellery was built for Adolf Hitler by Albert Speer. This building stood immediately south of the old Chancellery, on the corner of the Wilhelmstraße and Voßstraße, and its official address was Voßstraße 4, but the balcony from which Hitler addressed crowds faced the Wilhelmstraße. The square opposite the building, known as the Wilhelmplatz, no longer exists. Also vanished is the Kaiserhof Hotel, which stood a few doors away and had been Hitler's favoured residence in Berlin before he came to power.



The German Foreign Office stood at Wilhelmstraße 73, the old building being refurbished in grandiose style by the Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The Finance Ministry stood at Wilhelmstraße 61. During the Nazi years Joseph Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry stood further south at Wilhelmstraße 8 and 9. The Agriculture Ministry stood at Wilhelmstraße 72, as it still does today - the only German government ministry now located on its prewar site, although in a reconstructed building. The British Embassy was at Wilhelmstraße 70. The original building was destroyed by bombing, and a new Embassy built on the site after the reunification of Germany in 1991.



The only major surviving public building on the Wilhelmstraße from the Nazi era is the Reich Air Ministry building at Wilhelmstraße 81 to 85, south of Leipziger Straße, a huge edifice built on the orders of Hermann Göring between 1933 and 1936. This building escaped major damage during the war. As one of the few intact government buildings in central Berlin, it was occupied by the Council of Ministers of the new German Democratic Republic in 1949. As such it was at the centre of the popular demonstrations during the workers' uprising of 17 June 1953.



Apart from the Air Ministry, all the major public buildings along the Wilhelmstraße were destroyed by Allied bombing during 1944 and early 1945. The Wilhelmstraße as far south as Zimmerstraße was in the Soviet Zone of occupation, and apart from clearing the rubble from the street little was done to reconstruct the area until the founding of the GDR in 1949. The communist GDR regime regarded the former government precinct as a relic of Prussian and Nazi militarism and imperialism, and had all the ruins of the government buildings demolished in the early 1950s. In the late 1950s there were almost no buildings at all along the Wilhelmstraße from the Unter den Linden to Leipziger Straße. Later apartment blocks were built along this section of the street.



From 1964 to 1991, when the street as far south as Zimmerstraße was in the territory of the GDR, this section was named Otto-Grotewohl-Straße, after Otto Grotewohl, who was Prime Minister of the GDR from 1949 to 1964.



Today the Wilhelmstraße is an important traffic artery, but has not regained its former status. The Air Ministry building today houses the German Finance Ministry. This, the Agriculture Ministry and the British Embassy are the only public buildings on the street. Many of the occupants of the apartment blocks are recent immigrants, and there are a number of shops and restaurants catering to Russians and Turks.



In recent years the City of Berlin has placed a series of historical markers along the Wilhelmstraße, showing where the well-known buildings of the pre-war era stood.

7194258,Liberal religion,"Liberal religion is a religious tradition which embraces the theological diversity of a congregation rather than respecting any single creed, authority, or writing.  Because it may draw resources from many traditions, it cannot normally be characterized as Christian, Jewish, or any particular religious faith. Theologian James Luther Adams defined the ""five smooth stones of liberalism"" as:



Revelation and truth are not closed, but constantly revealed.

All relations between persons ought ideally to rest on mutual, free consent and not coercion.

Affirmation of the moral obligation to direct one's effort toward the establishment of a just and loving community.

Denial of the immaculate conception of virtue and affirmation of the necessity of social incarnation. Good must be consciously given form and power within history.

The resources (divine and human) that are available for achievement of meaningful change justify an attitude of ultimate (but not necessarily immediate) optimism. There is hope in the ultimate abundance of the Universe.;



Unitarian Universalist minister Kimi Riegel defined liberal religion as 



To be a liberal according to my favorite scripture, Merriam-Webster, is be open minded, is to be free from the constraints of dogmatism and authority, is to be generous and to believe in the basic goodness of humankind. Religion is defined as that which binds us back or reconnects us to that which is ultimately important. Thus religious liberals are those that are connected, through generosity and openness, to the most important aspects of life. And there in lies the challenge. If we are open minded and not bound by authority who or what decides those matters of ultimate importance?;

Do not leave personal belongings unattended even for a minute, in the library, a classroom or any other area.

Use the buddy system or get an escort when walking to and from the parking lots.  Always keep your keys in your hand.

Do not carry large amounts of money with you.

Use the Emergency Call Boxes or dial # then 1 from any campus payphone to report suspicious activities and incidents.

Lock your car and never leave valuables visible to the public.

Common sense is your best protection.

Brother Henry Foley was an English Roman Catholic church historian.



Biography.

He was born at Astley in Worcestershire, England on 9 August 1811; died at Manresa House, Roehampton, 19 November 1891. His father was the Protestant curate in charge at Astley. After his early education at home and at a private school at Woodchester, Henry was articled to a firm of solicitors in Worcester, and in course of time practised as a solicitor, at first in partnership with another, then by himself.

 

Under the influence of the Oxford Movement he was led to embrace the Catholic Faith in 1846, and five years later, on the death of his wife Anne, daughter of John Vezard of Gloucestershire, he sought admission as a lay brother into the Society of Jesus. Urged to enter as a scholastic and to prepare for the priesthood, he said it was Our Lady's wish that he should be a lay brother. For thirty years he occupied the post of lay brother socius to the English provincial superior.

 

During that time he produced his gigantic work, ""The Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus"" (8 octavo volumes), a compilation of immense labour and original research and an invaluable store of historical detail put together with a persevering assiduity rarely found even in the most painstaking of historians. Brother Foley deserves to share with Father Henry More the title of historian of the Society. He also wrote ""Jesuits in Conflict"", a work describing the sufferings of some of the English Jesuit confessors of the Faith.

 

As a religious, Brother Foley was a model of every virtue. His bodily austerities were remarkable, while his spirit of prayer led him at all free moments to the chapel.

History."
198299,Maundy money,"Maundy Money is a special British coinage given to deserving poor people in a religious ceremony performed by Anglicans on Maundy Thursday, the Thursday before Easter.



 History of the Maundy ceremony . 

The present-day Maundy ceremony has evolved over the centuries and bears little relationship to the original rites to which it owes its origins. A fundamental aspect of the original Maundy service was the washing of the feet of the poor, which has its origins in Jesus' washing of the feet of the Disciples at the Last Supper. In early ceremonies, senior clergymen would wash the feet of lower clergy, while in other ceremonies, the washing would be done by someone higher up the hierarchical order.



King Edward II (1307 1327) seems to be the first English monarch to have been recorded actively taking part in the ceremony, although King John (1199 1216) is said to have taken part in a ceremony in about 1210, donating small silver coins to the poor. King Edward III (1327 1377) washed feet and gave gifts including money to the poor; the practice continued regularly, with the participation of the monarch, until 1698. 



Although the monarch did not participate personally, later ceremonies continued in which a selection of people were given Maundy money consisting of silver pennies totalling, in pence, the current age of the monarch. The washing of feet ended after the 1736 ceremony, until it was re-instated in the 2003 ceremony, when it was performed by the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams.



In 1932, King George V agreed to take part personally in the distribution of the Maundy money, while the 1936 set was distributed by King Edward VIII, although the coins bore George V's effigy. By 1953 it had become normal practice for the monarch to distribute the Maundy money, a practice which continues to this day.



 Maundy coinage .

Until 1820 ordinary silver coinage was used for the Maundy money, but from 1822 special coins were minted in values of 1, 2, 3, and 4 pence. Each set of Maundy money therefore contains 10 pence, and recipients would be given an appropriate number of complete sets, plus a part-set when appropriate.



The dimensions and reverse designs of the coins have not changed since 1822, although their composition has changed over the years (not necessarily in ways which would be expected):



1 penny : weight 0.5 grams, diameter 11 millimetres.

2 pence : weight 0.9 grams, diameter 13 millimetres.

3 pence : weight 1.4 grams, diameter 16 millimetres.

4 pence : weight 1.9 grams, diameter 18 millimetres.



The original composition of the coins was Sterling (0.925) silver. In common with all circulating British silver coins, the fineness was reduced to 0.500 in 1921. In 1947, silver was removed from all circulating British coins in favour of cupronickel, but it was felt to be inappropriate to strike Maundy money in such debased metal, so unusually the fineness was restored to 0.925, where it remains to the present day.



In 1971, British currency was decimalised, with 100 new pence instead of 20 shillings of 12 pence (240 pence) in a pound. The design of the Maundy money was not changed at all, so instead of being worth 1, 2, 3, or 4 old pence, the coins are now worth 1, 2, 3, or 4 new pence, each one being worth 2.4 times its former value. As there is no difference in the design or weight between pre- and post-1971 coins, it was uniquely decided to revalue all pre-decimal Maundy coins back to 1822 at the equivalent value in new pence, i.e. the face value of each coin was increased by a factor of 2.4 overnight. All Maundy coins, back to 1822, remain legal tender in Britain at their stated value in new pence.



 Availability of the coins .

Victorian Maundy coins are quite common, as anybody could order a set from a bank, however in 1908, King Edward VII ordered that they should only be supplied to their recipients and people connected with the service, so coins dated 1909 and later are considerably scarcer than those which preceded them although of course the quantity increases as the monarch ages. (In 2006 Queen Elizabeth II turned 80, and thus 80 men and 80 women each received 80 pence in Maundy Money on April 13.). This year, they also received a special £5 coin which commemorated her 80th birthday as well as a 50p coin commemorating 150 years of the Victoria Cross.



Under a special privilege granted by Queen Elizabeth I, students in the youngest class of Westminster School also received Maundy coins, but this was discontinued in the 1970s.



Maundy coins, in proof condition, were sold as part of a special silver proof set of all United Kingdom coins in 2000.  They were also sold in gold as part of a special gold proof set of all United Kingdom coins in 2002, as part of the Golden Jubilee observances.

9878,Everway,"Everway is a fantasy role-playing game first published by Wizards of the Coast under their Alter Ego brand in the mid-1990s. Its lead designer was Jonathan Tweet.  Marketed as a ""Visionary Roleplaying Game"", it has often characterized as an innovative piece with a limited commercial success. Wizards later abandoned the line, and Rubicon Games purchased it, and published several supplements. The line was sold again to Gaslight Press in February 2001.



The game has a fantasy setting of the multiverse type, with many different worlds, some of which differed from generic fantasy. It appeares to have been heavily influenced by divinatory Tarot, the four classical elements of ancient Greece, and mythologies from around the world.



Everway was first with implementing, in a commercial game, several new concepts including much more picture-based/visual source material and character creation than usual. Like other works by Jonathan Tweet, the rules are very simple and flexible. It is also one of a few diceless role-playing games.  Although the Fortune Deck works as a randomizer, the results obtained by it are entirely arbitrary and subjective, and the GM's absolute power over the game is further emphasized by the three resolution systems: Karma (the higher character ability wins, modified by situation), Drama (the GM decides what happens, by what they think most appropriate), and Fortune (more or less the same as the above, with interpretation flavored by a card draw). The original edition contained the ""Fortune"" deck of thirty-six cards, used for ""divination"" and action-resolution, as well as ninety ""Vision"" cards used as source material. The cards were illustrated by Scott Kirschner and Jeff Miracola. The box also had three books of source material and gameplaying tips.

5411455,Calciphylaxis,"Calciphylaxis is a syndrome of vascular calcification and skin necrosis. It is seen almost exclusively in patients with end stage renal disease.  It results in chronic non-healing wounds and requires parathyroidectomy and hyperbaric therapy.



CALCIPHLAXIS is a rare but serious disease. 



What is it?.



Calciphylaxis is characterised by



 systemic medial calcification of the arteries, ie calcification of tunica media. Unlike other forms of vascular calcifications (eg, intimal, medial, valvular), calciphylaxis is characterised also by;

 small vessel mural calcification with or without endovascular fibrosis, extravascular calcification and vascular thrombosis, leading to tissue ischaemia (including skin ischaemia and, hence, skin necrosis). ;



The cause is not known. It does not seem to be an immune type reaction. In other words, calciphylaxis is not only a hypersensitivity reaction (= allergic reaction) leading to sudden local calcification. Clearly, additional factors are involved in calciphylaxis. It possibly could be described as calcific uraemic arteriolopathy.



Calciphylaxis is one type of extraskeletal calcification. Similar extraskeletal calcifications are observed in some patients with hypercalcaemic states, including patients with milk alkali syndrome, sarcoidosis, primary hyperparathyroidism, and hypervitaminosis D. 



Who is affected?.



Calciphylaxis most commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease who are on haemodialysis or who have recently received a renal transplant (= kidney transplant). Yet, calciphylaxis does not occur only in end-stage renal disease patients. It also has been reported in patients with breast cancer (treated with chemotherapy), liver cirrhosis (due to alcohol abuse), cholangiocarcinoma, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (including SLE patients with or without chronic renal disease). 



Diagnosis.



There is no diagnostic test for calciphylaxis. The diagnosis is a clinical one. The characteristic lesions are the ischaemic skin lesions (usually with areas of skin necrosis). They should alert the physician or nurse. 



The necrotic skin lesions (ie, the dying or already dead skin areas) typically appear as violaceous (dark bluish purple) lesions and/or completely black leathery lesions. They can be extensive.



The suspected diagnosis can be confirmed by a skin biopsy. It shows arterial calcification and occlusion in the absence of vasculitis. 



Treatment.



The optimal treatment is prevention. Rigorous and continuous control of phosphate and calcium balance most probably will avoid the metabolic changes which may lead to calciphylaxis. 



There is no specific treatment. Of the treatments that exist, none is internationally recognised as the standard of care. An acceptable treatment could include: 



Dialysis (the number of sessions may be increased);

Intensive wound care;

Adequate pain control;

Correction of the underlying plasma calcium and phosphorus abnormalities (lowering the Ca x P product below 55 mg2/dL2);

Avoiding (further) local tissue trauma (including avoiding all subcutaneous injections, and all not-absolutely-necessary infusions and transfusions);

Urgent parathyroidectomy: ???. The efficacy of this measure remains uncertain although calciphylaxis is associated with frank hyperparathyroidism. Urgent parathyroidectomy may benefit those patients who have uncontrollable plasma calcium and phosphorous concentrations despite dialysis. Also, cinacalcet can be used and may serve as an alternative to parathyroidectomy. The trade name of cinacalcet is Sensipar or Mimpara.

Patients who receive kidney transplants also receive immunosuppression. Considering lowering the dose of or discontinuing the use of immunosuppressive drugs in renal transplant patients who continue to have persistent or progressive calciphylactic skin lesions can contribute to an acceptable treatment of calciphylaxis.



Response to treatment.



Unfortunately, response to treatment is not guaranteed. Also, the necrotic skin areas may get infected, and this then may lead to sepsis (ie, infection of blood with bacteria; sepsis can be life-threatening) in some patients. Overall, the clinical prognosis remains poor.



Who to contact?.



The correct person to ask questions about calciphylaxis is a nephrology fellow or a professor of nephrology.

5558825,Zuras,"Zuras is a fictional character appearing in the Marvel Comics universe.  He is a member of the Eternals.



Fictional character biography.

Zuras is the son of the Eternals Kronos and Daina, and brother of A'Lars.  With his wife Cybele, he has a daughter Thena.



Zuras was the first Eternal to form a Uni-Mind, and was chosen by the Eternals to lead them following Kronos' death. He was mistaken for the Greek god Zeus many times in the past, and ultimately forged a pact with Zeus to keep their people at peace. When Kro spread chaos in the 1940s, Zuras sent Makkari to oppose him. He also forced the Forgotten One into exile, stripped him of his name, and forbade the Eternals from communicating with him. Zuras appears to have been well-traveled, since his quarters in Olympia were decorated with a jukebox, two six-shooters and battle-axes.



Zuras authorized Thena to resume her battles against the Deviants, and ordered her to battle against Zakka in New York.  He also aided Mr. Bradford, a government agent, in studying the Celestials. Zuras allied himself with Odin in his assault on the 4th Host of Celestials, and formed the Uni-Mind for battle. However, the Uni-Mind was blown apart by the Celestials, and the backlash killed Zuras. Even then, Zuras' spirit continued to exist within his body, until his body was finally destroyed by freeing Thena from a Brain-Mine. Zuras' spirit still seems to exist, as it has appeared at times within Olympia, such as when Ikaris challenged Thena for the title of Prime Eternal.



The Eternals (2006) .





More recently, Zuras has briefly appeared in the new Marvel mini-series The Eternals, written by Neil Gaiman. 



Sprite states that he used the machineries of Olympia to partially ""reactivate"" Zuras - and then deceived Zuras into visiting the tomb of the Dreaming Celestial, forming a uni-mind there. This provided Sprite with the power he needed to rewrite some aspects of reality, stripping the other Eternals of their powers and memories. Sprite also stated that he considers Zuras to be the most powerful of the Eternals.



In the ""rewritten"" world, Zuras was made into an alcoholic homeless man, with mental problems.  He was, however, restored by Ajak.

3094108,Harvey Ward,"Harvey Grenville Ward (1927 1995) was born in Southern Rhodesia to an English father and a German mother. His parents went as European settlers in Africa and were engaged in enterprises such as the financing of railroad construction and the building of numerous hotels.  His parents owned and the family resided in the Victoria Falls Hotel.  In his adult life, Ward became known for his anti-communism and for his support of white minority rule  in Rhodesia and South Africa.



Harvey Ward chose a career in journalism, in which time he was a sports editor, foreign correspondent, and political columnist.  He eventually became Director-General of the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (today's Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation) which, in effect, put him in charge of government propaganda.  Ward is said to have removed references to black sporting achievements from sports programmes carried on state television (The Herald, 6 April 1999).



Following an armed insurrection and several years of negotiations, the white minority government of Rhodesia was replaced by African majority rule in 1979-80.  Ward described this as ""the betrayal of western nations to their own kin"".  As a prominent supporter of the white minority government, Ward was forced to leave the new country of Zimbabwe.  He and his family departed for South Africa, and advised the white minority government there on avoiding international economic sanctions.



Subsequently, Harvey Ward served as a political adviser to many African leaders and was involved in international intelligence. His watch-word became ""dedicated to fighting communism"" and he travelled world-wide lecturing on counter-insurgency and terrorism. He described the Soviet Union as run by ""gangsters"" and totally untrustworthy.



He supported the anti-communist revolts in the former Soviet Bloc saying that it was ""a simple matter of good versus evil"".  In Africa, Ward saw no hope. ""Africa is the most exploited of all the continents, and it will stay that way. There has never been any peace in Africa, and I see no end to tribal conflict, spreading of diseases and other plagues"", he said.



Harvey Ward was the centre of a minor sensation in on the 26 July 1977 when immigration officials at Heathrow Airport held him for seven hours, before formally refusing him permission to enter Britain, and placing him on board another plane to Munich. He was due to address a meeting of the Africa Committee of the Conservative Monday Club at the House of Lords, organised by the former Tory M.P.,Harold Soref, on the 29th, and visit family in Gloucestershire. On being asked why entry had never been refused on previous journeys to Britain by Mr.Ward, a Home Office spokesman said ""I don't know. It may have been a mistake or oversight"". Formal protests were made to the Home Office by Tory M.P.'s John Biggs-Davison, Patrick Wall, and Teddy Taylor. (Daily Telegraph, and Daily Mail, 27 July 1977).



In 1986, his wife died and though three of his four children lived in South Africa, Ward decided to move on to Britain.



At the October 1988 Conservative Party Conference, Western Goals (UK) held a fringe meeting on the subject of ""International Terrorism - how the West can fight back"". Harvey Ward, Sir Alfred Sherman, Rev Martin Smyth, MP, and Andrew Hunter, MP, were the speakers. The latter spoke concerning top-level links between the IRA and ANC.



In 1989, Harvey Ward was working for his old friend James Gibb Stuart at Ossian Books Ltd., in Glasgow. He continued to travel and lecture, and joined the Conservative Party.  He was an active member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Conservative Monday Club.



Ward was a supporter of the Western Goals Institute. 



In 1991, Ward worked in conjunction with South African security policeman Paul Erasmus to secretly leak false accusations against Winnie Mandela and her daughters, accusing them of being nymphomaniacs and drug abusers.  The reports were described as having come from dissidents in the African National Congress, and were issued in an effort to divide the ANC's leadership.  They were subsequently taken up by papers such as The Independent, the Sunday Times and Vanity Fair.  Erasmus later acknowledged profound regret for his actions in this and other matters, and affected a reconciliation with Mandela.  He revealed Ward's role in the propaganda campaign during the late 1990s (Irish Times, 27 March 1999).



In the early 1990s, Ward's fourth child, who had been in the British Police Service returned to live in South Africa and Ward followed, taking up residence in Port Elizabeth, where he later had a heart attack during a game of bowls, and died.

The grape is grown primarily in the Loire Valley around Anjou and is known for the high yields that the vine can produce. The vine is generally reliable and disease resistant, producing well even after suffering through a spring frost, however the berries tend to be difficult to crush which leads the grape to some disfavor among winemakers. The exact parentage of this hybrid is unknown but the two most popular theories are the crosses of two Seibel grapes, Seibel 867 x Seibel 2524, and the Seibel 4461 crossed with Berlandieri-Jacquez.

6558201,Michele Cavataio,"Michele Cavataio (died December 10, 1969, Palermo), also known as The Cobra was a powerful member of the Sicilian Mafia. He was the boss of the Acquasanta mandamento in Palermo and was a member of the first Sicilian Mafia Commission.



Early Mafia career.

Cavataio was seen as an exponent of a  new  Mafia of Americanised gangsters that appeared in the mid 1950s. After World War II, he made his fortune selling petrol that was stolen from the Italian Navy. The Acquasanta Mafia family controlled the docks of Palermo that were situated in their area. They acted as strike breakers against the dockworkers, and did not hesitate to shoot at the strikers if necessary. 



In 1955, the bosses of the Acquasanta Mafia clan, Gaetano Galatolo and Nicola D Alessandro were killed in a dispute over the protection rackets when the fruit and vegetable wholesale market moved from the Zisa area to Acquasanta, disturbing the delicate power balances within Cosa Nostra. The killer of Galatolo was never identified, but Cavataio was suspected. Cavataio became the new boss of the clan and had to agree to split the profits of the wholesale market racket with the Greco Mafia family of Ciaculli, who traditionally controlled fruit and vegetable supply to Palermo wholesale market.



Cavataio actively participated in what is called the  sack of Palermo  during the reign of Salvo Lima as mayor of Palermo. Mafia bosses were granted building licenses through contacts with politicians. The construction boom destroyed the city's green belt and villas that gave it architectural grace, to make way for characterless and shoddily constructed apartment blocks.



First Mafia War.

Cavataio was one of the protagonists of the first Mafia War in 1962-63. According to the pentito Tommaso Buscetta it was Michele Cavataio who deliberately escalated a dispute between different factions. The conflicted erupted over an underweight shipment of heroin. The shipment was financed by Cesare Manzella, the Greco cousins from Ciaculli and the La Barbera brothers. Suspicion fell on Calcedonio Di Pisa, who had collected the heroin and had organised the transport to New York.



The case was brought before the Mafia Commission, but disagreement on how to handle it, led to a bloody conflict between clan s allied with the Greco s, headed by Salvatore Ciaschiteddu Greco, and clan s allied with the La Barbera s   in particular when Di Pisa was killed on December 26, 1962. The Greco s suspected the La Barbera s of the attack. 



However, it had been Cavataio who had killed Di Pisa in the knowledge that the Greco s would blame the La Barbera s and a war would be the result. Cavataio  having his own problems with Di Pisa and wanting him out of the way, and on bad terms with the La Barbera s as well   contrived Di Pisa s murder in such a way that the La Barbera s would appear responsible. He kept fuelling the conflict with more bomb attacks and killings. Other Mafia families who resented the growing power of the Sicilian Mafia Commission to the detriment of individual Mafia families backed Cavataio. 



Cavataio then participated, along with Buscetta and another Acquasanta capo, in several car bomb attacks on the Greco s and their allies, considered enemies because of their intrusion in the wholesale produce market. He was responsible for a car bomb that exploded near Greco s house in Ciaculli on June 30, 1963, killing seven police and military officers sent to defuse it after an anonymous phone call. The outrage over the Ciaculli massacre changed the Mafia war into a war against the Mafia. It prompted the first concerted anti-Mafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy. The Sicilian Mafia Commission was dissolved and of those mafiosi who had escaped arrest many went abroad. Cavataio was arrested.



The Ciaculli bombing made the other Mafia clans aware of Cavataio s manipulation of the Mafia War. When the bomd exploded, Salvatore La Barbera was already dead and his brother Angelo La Barbera had fled to Milan, where he was seriously wounded. It became clear that Cavataio   and not the La Barbera s   had planted the bomb and fomented much of the trouble.



Killed by the Mafia.

Cavataio received a four year sentence at the Trial of the 114 against the Mafia in Catanzaro in December 1968, despite an indictment for ten murders. He was sentenced for criminal association and soon left jail when in appeal his sentence was reduced to two years. However, by then the Mafia had realised Cavataio s double-crossing role in the Mafia war. In retaliation, during a meeting in Zürich several top Mafia bosses decided to eliminate Cavataio on the instigation of Salvatore Ciaschiteddu Greco who had come all the way from Venezuela. Greco had come to subscribe to Buscetta s theory about how the First Mafia War began.



Cavataio and three of his men were killed on December 10, 1969, in the Viale Lazio in Palermo by a Mafia hit squad including Bernardo Provenzano, Calogero Bagarella (an elder brother of Leoluca Bagarella the brother-in-law of Totò Riina), Emanuele D Agostino of Stefano Bontade s Santa Maria di Gesù Family and Damiano Caruso a soldier of Giuseppe Di Cristina, the Mafia boss of Riesi. 



The killers entered the office of the construction company of Girolamo Moncada, the builder that previously was connected with Anglo La Barbera and now with Cavataio. Cavataio was able to shoot and kill Calogero Bagarella and wounding one of Di Cristina s men before Provenzano killed him. Provenzano saved the situation with his Beretta 38/A submachine gun and earned himself a reputation as a Mafia killer with the attack. 



The composition of the hit squad, according to Buscetta, was a clear indication thet the killing had been sanctioned collectively by all the major Sicilian Mafia families: not only did it include Calogero Bagarella from Corleone, and a member of Stefano Bontate s family in Palermo, but also a soldier of Giuseppe Di Cristina s family on the other end of Sicily in Riesi. The Viale Lazio bloodbath marked the end of a  pax mafiosa  that had reigned since the Ciaculli massacre until the end of the Trial of the 114.

2542237,Check washing,"Check washing is the process of erasing checks, enabling the rewriting thereof, usually for criminal purposes such as fraudulent withdrawal from the victim's bank account.



Various steps can be taken by the writer of the check to reduce the possibility of falling victim to check washing.  These include mailing checks by placing them in secured mailboxes, using secure ink dispensed from a gel, rollerball, or fountain pen, the filling in of all lines on the check, and careful scrutiny of bank statements.



The actual process of washing a check is relatively simple, and can be accomplished with basic solvents.  Among many others, possible solvents include alcohol or nail polish remover.  The actual solvent is largely irrelevant   more importantly, the polarity of the solvent is important, and must match the polarity of the dye in the ink.  For example, an ink that is mostly made of a polar dye would require a polar solvent (i.e. isopropanol or acetone).  Similarly, a non-polar dye would require a non-polar solvent (i.e. toluene or a similar hydrocarbon). Both nail polish remover (acetone) and isopropanol are polar molecules, and are able to pull most common inks away from paper quite easily, in a matter of minutes.

1764593,Lever escapement,"The lever escapement is a key component of the typical movement found in most mechanical wristwatches, pocket watches and many small mechanical non-pendulum clocks.  

The invention of the lever escapement is attributed to Thomas Mudge, and its modern form was developed by subsequent workers including Breguet and Massey.  It is a detached escapement, which means that the time-keeping element runs entirely free of interfernce from the escapement during a portion of the operating cycle.



The rotation of the escape wheel is controlled by the pallets.  The escape wheel has specially shaped teeth of either ratchet or club form, which interact with the two jewels called the entrance and exit pallets.  The escape wheel, except in unusual cases, has 15 teeth and is made of steel.  These pallets are attached solidly to the lever, which has at its end a fork to receive the ruby impulse pin of the balance roller.  In modern design it is common for the pallet mountings and the fork to be made as a single component.



As the escape wheel rotates, a tooth will slide across the sloping impulse plane of the entrance pallet.  This will turn the pallets about their axis, which places the exit pallet into the path of the rotating escape wheel.  Thus, once the tooth leaves the impulse plane of the entrance pallet, the wheel is only able to turn a small amount (called the drop) until a tooth of the escape wheel lands on the locking face of the exit pallet.   The wheel is said to be locked on the exit pallet.  From the release from the entrance pallet to this point, the escape wheel will have turned through exactly half of the angle between two teeth.



The impulse received by the pallet as the tooth moves over the impulse face is transferred by the lever to the balance wheel via the ruby pin on the roller of the balance.  The lever moves until it rests against the banking (either solid, or a pin); it is held in this position  by the draw of the pallet jewels; this means that in order to unlock the wheel it must be turned backwards by a small amount.



After the drop, the balance wheel will rotate free of interference from the escapement until the impulse pin enters the fork again while moving in the opposite direction.  This will unlock the escapement, which releases the escape wheel so that a tooth can slide over the impulse plane of the exit pallet, which transfers an impulse via the lever to the impulse pin.  The escape wheel drops against until a tooth locks on the entrance pallet. The cycle then starts again.



 Draw .

The reliability of the modern lever escapement depends upon draw; the pallets are  angled so that the escape wheel must recoil a small amount during the unlocking; this holds the lever against the banking during the detached portion of the operating cycle.  Draw angle is typically about 15 degrees to the radial.



Early lever escapements lacked draw (indeed some makers considered it injurious as a cause of extra friction in unlocking) as a result a jolt could result in the escapement unlocking.



 Lever watch movement .

Most modern mechanical watches are jeweled lever watches, using manmade ruby or sapphire jewels for the high-wear areas of the watch.  Until the late 1970s, pin-lever watches were common. These are nearly identical in operation, except that the fork jewels are replaced by plain steel parts.  Most pin-lever watches have no jewels, or a single, mostly useless jewel.    



Mechanical movements have largely been replaced by electrically operated quartz watches which are cheaper, just as reliable and more accurate.  



How a typical lever escapement movement works: 

 

The crown and stem turn the keyless works, which when in the wind position turns the inside loops of the mainspring coil. The mainspring is inside the barrel, with the outside of the mainspring attached to the barrel. The barrel turns the center wheel once per hour   this wheel has a shaft that goes through the dial. On the dial side the cannon pinion is attached with a friction fit (allowing it to slide when setting the hands) and the minute hand is attached to the cannon pinion.  There is a small wheel driven by the minute wheel that in turn drives the hour wheel and hand once for every 12 revolutions of the minute hand.  



The center wheel drives the third wheel, which in turn drives the fourth wheel.  On most watches, the fourth wheel is geared to rotate once per minute, and on most watches with ""sub seconds"" (seconds on a small subdial between the center and edge of the watch) rather than the more common center seconds, the second hand is attached directly to this wheel. The fourth wheel drives the escapement wheel or escape wheel. 



The combination of hairspring stiffness and length works with the  diameter and mass of the balance wheel to precisely control the rate of the watch according to Hooke's law.  Depending on the watch, this process happens at an exact rate between 2.5 and 5 times per second, causing the second  hand to pulse forward 5 to 10 times per second. The speed of this process is almost independent of the rest of the watch.  More or less force (as in the difference between a fully wound mainspring and a nearly unwound) will change how far the balance wheel swings, but under normal operation will not significantly change how long it takes to complete a cycle.  



If either the effective length or strength of the hairspring are changed, or the mass or diameter of the balance are changed, the rate of the watch will change.  Most watches are regulated with a moveable regulator that grips the spring at a point near the outside end, changing the effective length.  Some watches have screws around the balance   by adding or removing washers under these screws, coarse adjustments to rate can be made.  Some high-end ""Free-Sprung"" watches do not have a traditional regulator, instead relying on moveable weights to fine-tune the balance

4576681,Laurel House Railroad Station,"The Laurel House Station, branch MP 18.5, was built as part of the three-foot gauge Kaaterskill Railroad, an extension of the Stony Clove and Catskill Mountain Railroad. It was built so passengers could stop there and take a horse and carriage to the Laurel House, a hotel that was nearby. When it was built, it was anything but an actual station; in fact, it was nothing but a platform. When the Ulster and Delaware standard-gauged the railroad in 1899, it was replaced with an actual station. The branch it served would become an actual part of the railroad in 1903.



It was square shaped, and like most other stations on the U&D, had a built-in gutter. It was well operated until the late 1930s. That's when it became nothing but a flagstop, where one would have to wave a tin flag to get a train to stop. It was abandoned when the Kaaterskill branch was abandoned in 1939, and eventually scrapped in 1940, along with the Stony Clove Branch, and the Hunter Branch. The New York State Government decided to get rid of the station, and eventually burnt it to the ground."
62436,Puberty,"Puberty refers to the process of physical changes by which a child's body becomes an adult body capable of reproduction. Growth accelerates in the first half of puberty and reaches completion by the end. Body differences between boys and girls before puberty are almost entirely restricted to the genitalia. During puberty major differences of size, shape, composition, and function develop in many body structures and systems. The most obvious of these are referred to as secondary sex characteristics. In a strict sense, the term puberty (and this article) refers to the bodily changes of sexual maturation rather than the psychosocial and cultural aspects of adolescent development. 



Adolescence is the period of psychological and social transition between childhood and adulthood. Adolescence largely overlaps the period of puberty but its boundaries are less precisely defined and it refers as much to the psychosocial and cultural characteristics of development during the teen years as to the physical changes of puberty. Children and young adolescents near the average age of puberty are sometimes referred to as peripubescent in medical literature.



The physical changes of puberty in girls.

Breast development.

The first physical sign of puberty in girls is usually a firm, tender lump under the center of the areola(e) of one or both breasts, occurring on average at about 10 years of age. This is referred to as thelarche. By the widely used Tanner staging of puberty, this is stage 2 of breast development (stage 1 is a flat, prepubertal breast). Within 6-12 months, the swelling has clearly begun in both sides, softened, and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months (stage 4), the breasts are approaching mature size and shape, with areolae and papillae forming a secondary mound. In most young women, this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast (stage 5), although there is so much variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that distinguishing advanced stages is of little clinical value.



Pubic hair in girls.

Pubic hair is often the second unequivocal change of puberty. It is referred to as pubarche and the pubic hairs are usually visible first along the labia. The first few hairs are described as Tanner stage 2. Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6-12 months, when the hairs are too numerous to count and appear on the pubic mound as well. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the ""pubic triangle."" Stage 5 refers to spread of pubic hair to the thighs and sometimes as abdominal hair upward towards the navel.  In about 15% of girls, the earliest pubic hair appears before breast development begins.



Vagina, uterus, ovaries.

The mucosal surface of the vagina also changes in response to increasing levels of estrogen, becoming thicker and a duller pink in color (in contrast to the brighter red of the prepubertal vaginal mucosa). Whitish secretions (physiologic leukorrhea) are a normal effect of estrogen as well. In the next 2 years following thelarche, the uterus and ovaries increase in size. The ovaries usually contain small cysts visible by ultrasound.



Menstruation and fertility.

The first menstrual bleeding is referred to as menarche. The average age of menarche in American girls is about 12.7 years, usually about 2 years after thelarche. Menses (menstrual periods) are not always regular and monthly in the first 2 years after menarche. Ovulation is necessary for fertility, and may or may not accompany the earliest menses. By 2 years after menarche, most girls are ovulating at least several times a year. Over 90% of girls who experience menarche before age 13 years are experiencing very regular, predictable menses accompanied by ovulation within 2 years, and a higher proportion of those with later menarche may not establish regular ovulation for 4 years or more.  However, initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable, and a high proportion of girls with continued irregularity several years from menarche will continue to have prolonged irregularity and anovulation, and are at higher risk for reduced fertility. 



The word nubility has been proposed academically to designate achievement of fertility.



Pelvic shape, fat distribution, and body composition.

During this period, also in response to rising levels of estrogen, the lower half of the pelvis widens (providing a larger birth canal).  Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis. This produces the typical female body shape.



Body odor, skin changes, and acne.

Rising levels of androgens can change the fatty acid composition of perspiration, resulting in a more ""adult"" body odor. This often precedes thelarche and pubarche by 1 or more years. Another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil (sebum) from the skin. This change increases the susceptibility to acne, a characteristic affliction of puberty greatly variable in its severity.



The physical changes of puberty in boys.

Testicular size, function, and fertility.

In boys, testicular enlargement is the first physical manifestation of puberty (and is termed gonadarche). Testes in prepubertal boys change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset of puberty, averaging about 2 3 cc in volume and about 1.5-2 cm in length. Testicular size continues to increase throughout puberty, reaching maximal adult size about 6 years later. While 18-20 cc is reportedly an average adult size, there is wide variation in the normal population. 



The testes have two primary functions: to produce hormones and to produce sperm. The Leydig cells produce testosterone (as described below), which in turn produces most of the changes of male puberty. However, most of the increasing bulk of testicular tissue is spermatogenic tissue (primarily Sertoli and interstitial cells). The development of sperm production and fertility in males is not as well documented. Sperm can be detected in the morning urine of most boys after the first year of pubertal changes (and occasionally earlier).



Genitalia.

A boy's penis grows little from the fourth year of life until puberty. After the penile growth of early infancy the average childhood penile length is about 7 cm. The prepubertal genitalia are described as stage 1. Within months after growth of the testes begins, rising levels of testosterone promote growth of the penis and scrotum. This earliest discernible beginning of pubertal growth of the genitalia is referred to as stage 2.  The penis continues to grow until about 18 years of age, reaching an average adult size of about 10-16 cm.



Although erections and orgasm occur in prepubertal boys, they become much more common during puberty, accompanied by a markedly increased libido. Ejaculation becomes possible early in puberty; prior to this boys may experience dry orgasms. Emission of seminal fluid may occur due to masturbation or spontaneously during sleep (commonly termed a wet dream, and more clinically called a nocturnal emission). The ability to ejaculate is a fairly early event in puberty compared to the other characteristics. However, in parallel to the irregularity of the first few periods of a girl, for the first one or two years after a boy's first ejaculation, his seminal fluid may contain few active sperm.



If the foreskin of a boy does not become retractable during childhood, it normally begins to retract during puberty. This occurs as a result of the increased production of testosterone and other hormones in the body.



Pubic hair in boys.

Pubic hair often appears on a boy shortly after the genitalia begin to grow. As in girls, the first appearance of pubic hair is termed pubarche and the pubic hairs are usually first visible at the dorsal (abdominal) base of the penis. The first few hairs are described as stage 2. Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6 12 months, when the hairs are too numerous to count. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the ""pubic triangle."" Stage 5 refers to spread of pubic hair to the thighs and upward towards the navel as part of the developing abdominal hair.



Body and facial hair in boys. 

In the months and years following the appearance of pubic hair, other areas of skin which respond to androgens develop heavier hair (androgenic hair) in roughly the following sequence: underarm (axillary) hair, perianal hair, upper lip hair, sideburn (preauricular) hair, periareolar hair, and the rest of the beard area. Arm, leg, chest, abdominal, and back hair become heavier more gradually. There is a large range in amount of body hair among adult men, and significant differences in timing and quantity of hair growth among different ethnic groups.



Voice change.

Under the influence of androgens, the voice box, or larynx, grows in both genders. This growth is far more prominent in boys, causing the male voice to drop, sometimes abruptly but never ""over night"", about one octave, because the longer and thicker vocal folds have a lower fundamental frequency. Voices never ""break."" A typical 12-year old boy's larynx is larger, even before voice change, than an adult woman's. Occasionally, voice change is accompanied by unsteadiness of vocalization in the early stages of untrained voices. Most of the voice change happens during stage 4 of male puberty around the time of peak growth. However, it usually precedes the development of significant facial hair by several months to years.



Height growth in boys.

Compared to girls' early growth spurt, growth accelerates more slowly in boys and lasts longer, resulting in a taller adult stature among males than females (on average about 10 cm or 4 inches). The difference is attributed to the much greater potency of estradiol compared to testosterone in promoting bone growth, maturation, and epiphyseal closure. In boys, growth begins to accelerate about 9 months after the first signs of testicular enlargement and the peak year of the growth spurt occurs about 2 years after the onset of puberty, reaching a peak velocity of about 8.5 12 cm or 3.5 5 inches per year. The feet and hands experience their growth spurt first, followed by the limbs, and finally ending in the trunk. Epiphyseal closure and adult height are reached more slowly, at an average age of about 17.5 years.  As in girls, this last growth primarily involves the spine rather than the limbs.



Male musculature and body shape.

By the end of puberty, adult men have heavier bones and nearly twice as much skeletal muscle. Some of the bone growth (e.g., shoulder width and jaw) is disproportionately greater, resulting in noticeably different male and female skeletal shapes. The average adult male has about 150% of the lean body mass of an average female, and about 50% of the body fat. 



This muscle develops mainly during the later stages of puberty, and muscle growth can continue even after a male is biologically adult. The peak of the so-called ""strength spurt,"" the rate of muscle growth, is attained about one year after a male experiences his peak growth rate.



Body odor, skin changes, acne.

Rising levels of androgens can change the fatty acid composition of perspiration, resulting in a more ""adult"" body odor. As in girls, another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil (sebum) from the skin and the resultant variable amounts of acne.





Breast development in boys: pubertal gynecomastia.

Estradiol is produced from testosterone in male puberty as well as female, and male breasts often respond to the rising estradiol levels. This is termed gynecomastia. In most boys, the breast development is minimal, similar to what would be termed a ""breast bud"" in a girl, but in many boys, breast growth is substantial. It usually occurs after puberty is underway, may increase for a year or two, and usually diminishes by the end of puberty. It is increased by extra adipose tissue if the boy is overweight.



Although this is a normal part of male puberty for perhaps half of boys, breast development is usually as unwelcome as upper lip hair in girls, and can be removed surgically if the boy's distress is substantial.



Variations of normal puberty.



Typical puberty is described above, but many children vary with respect to timing of onset, tempo, steadiness of continuation, and sequence of events.



Timing of onset.

Puberty is a process with a gradual onset beginning with changes of neuronal function in the hypothalamus, resulting in rising hormonal signals between brain and gonads, proceeding to gonadal growth and production of sex steroids, which in turn induce changes in responsive parts of the body. The definition of onset, therefore, depends on the perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late children, or a variety of other social purposes). The most commonly used definition of onset for both social and medical purposes is the appearance of the first physical changes described in this section of this article, but it should be understood that these physical changes are the first outward signs of preceding neural, hormonal, and gonadal function changes that are usually impossible or impractical to detect.  



The age at which puberty begins can vary widely between individuals and between populations. Age of puberty is affected by both genetic factors and by environmental factors such as nutritional state or social circumstances.  Timing may also be affected by environmental factors (exogenous hormones and environmental substances with hormone-like effects) and there is even evidence that life experiences may play a role as well. 



Ethnic/racial differences have been recognized for centuries. For example, the average age of menarche in various populations surveyed in the last several decades has ranged from 12.0 to 18.5 years. The earliest mean is reported for African-American girls and the oldest for high altitude subsistence populations in Asia. However, it is clear that much of the higher age averages reflect nutritional limitations more than genetic differences and can change within a few generations with a substantial change in diet. The median age of menarche for a population may be an index of the proportion of undernourished girls in the population, and the width of the spread may reflect unevenness of wealth and food distribution in a population.



Genetic influence on pubertal timing.

Various studies have found direct genetic effects to account for at least 50% of the variation of timing of puberty in well-nourished populations. The genetic association of timing is strongest between mothers and daughters. The specific genes affecting timing are not defined yet. Among the candidates are the androgen and LH receptor genes.



Environmental factors affecting pubertal timing.

If genetic factors account for half of the variation of pubertal timing, environment factors are clearly important as well. One of the earliest observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs later in children raised at higher altitudes. The most important of the environmental influences is clearly nutrition, but a number of others have been identified, all which affect timing of female puberty and menarche more clearly than male puberty.



Nutritional influence on pubertal timing.

Nutritional factors are the strongest and most obvious environmental factors affecting timing of puberty. Girls are especially sensitive to nutritional regulation because they must contribute all of the nutritional support to a growing fetus. Surplus calories (beyond growth and activity requiriements) are reflected in the amount of body fat, which signals to the brain the availability of resources for initiation of puberty and fertility. 



Much evidence suggests that for most of the last few centuries, nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations, and even among social classes in the same population. Recent worldwide increased consumption of animal protein, other changes in nutrition, and increases in childhood fatness have resulted in falling ages of puberty, mainly in those populations with the higher previous ages. In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking.



Although available dietary energy (simple calories) is the most important dietary influence on timing of puberty, quality of the diet plays a role as well. Lower protein intakes and higher plant fiber intakes, as occur with typical vegetarian diets, are associated with later onset and slower progression of female puberty.



Studies have shown that calcium deficiency is a cause of late puberty, irregular and painful, cramping during menstration with excessive blood loss, and lowered immune response to infections in young girls.  This could be from a deficient diet or lack of vitamin D from too little sun exposure.  This lack of calcium could predispose them to osteoporosis later in life.



Effect of physical activity and exercise on pubertal timing.

The average level of daily physical activity has also been shown to affect timing of puberty, especially female. A high level of exercise, whether for athletic or body image purposes, or for daily subsistence, reduces energy calories available for reproduction and slows puberty. The exercise effect is often amplified by a lower body fat mass.



Effect of physical illness on pubertal timing.

Many chronic diseases can delay puberty in both boys and girls. Those that involve chronic inflammation or interfere with nutrition have the strongest effect. In the western world, inflammatory bowel disease and tuberculosis have been notorious for such an effect in the last century, while in areas of the underdeveloped world, chronic parasite infections are widespread.



Effect of environmental chemicals and hormones on pubertal timing.

There is theoretical concern, and animal evidence, that environmental hormones and chemicals may affect aspects of prenatal or postnatal sexual development in humans. Large amounts of incompletely metabolized estrogens and progestagens from pharmaceutical products are excreted into the sewage systems of large cities, and are sometimes detectable in the environment. Sex steroids are sometimes used in cattle farming but have been banned in chicken meat production for 40 years. Although agricultural laws regulate use to minimize accidental human consumption, the rules are largely self-enforced in the United States. Significant exposure of a child to hormones or other substances that activate estrogen or androgen receptors could produce some or all of the changes of puberty.



Harder to detect as an influence on puberty are the more diffusely distributed environmental chemicals like PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), which can bind and trigger estrogen receptors.



More obvious degrees of partial puberty from direct exposure of young children to small but significant amounts of pharmaceutical sex steroids from exposure at home may be detected during medical evaluation for precocious puberty, but mild effects and the other potential exposures outlined above would not.



Effect of stress and social factors on pubertal timing.

Some of the least understood environmental influences on timing of puberty are social and psychological. In comparison with the effects of genetics, nutrition, and general health, social influences are small, shifting timing by a few months rather than years. Mechanisms of these social effects are unknown, though a variety of physiological processes, including pheromones, have been suggested based on animal research.



The most important part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty. Most of the studies have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in girls in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged sexual abuse in childhood, or who are adopted from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, menarche may be slightly later when a girl grows up in a large family with a biological father present.



More extreme degrees of environmental stress, such as wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival, have been found to be associated with delay of maturation, an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy.



Most of these reported social effects are small and our understanding is incomplete. Most of these ""effects"" are statistical associations revealed by epidemiologic surveys. Statistical associations are not necessarily causal, and a variety of covariables and alternative explanations can be imagined. Effects of such small size can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child. Furthermore, interpretations of the data are politically controversial because of the ease with which this type of research can be used for political advocacy. Accusations of bias based on political agenda sometimes accompany scientific criticism.



Another limitation of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and partly because it involves a unique event (menarche) that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male. More detail is provided in the menarche article.



Average timing for American children.

Some of the most complete reference data are available for American children and are included here. Average age for first signs of breast development in girls is about 10.5 years. Average age for first signs of testicular enlargement in boys is 11.5 years. See Tables below for approximate average ages and ranges for other milestones of physical development of North American children. 



Duration of puberty (time from onset to completion) varies less between children than does the age of onset. Duration of puberty in girls from onset of breast development to cessation of growth is roughly 5 years. Duration of puberty in boys from first testicular enlargement to cessation of growth is about 6 years. 



Table 1 provides 3rd, 50th, and 97th percentiles for attainment of selected stages by American girls, based on NCHS data collected in the 1970s and reported in 1985 (Tanner et al., 1985). In these tables, B, PH, and G refer to the Tanner stages of physical puberty: B is breast, PH is pubic hair, and G is genitalia (penis and testes). B1, PH1, and G1 are the prepubertal stages of each of these, while B2, PH2, and G2 are the earliest signs of puberty. B5, PH5, and G5 are adult stages at the end of puberty. The Tanner stage article contains links to fuller explanations of the specific stages. All three tables below express ages as years and months (y and m).







However, a later survey performed in the mid-1990s by a group of American primary pediatric practices with slightly different methods reported both a mildly earlier average onset, greater range, and more importantly, a significant difference between white and African-American girls in the early stages (Table 2) (Herman-Giddens et al.).











----











Variations of tempo and progression.



Tempo is the speed at which the process of pubertal changes progresses from beginning to end. The duration of puberty generally varies less than timing of onset, and approximates 4 years for girls and 6 for boys (from first physical changes to attainment of adult height). Nevertheless, some healthy children can proceed through puberty at a faster or slower tempo than most.



An interruption of progression of puberty is usually, but not always, due to abnormal causes such as malnutrition or anorexia nervosa. Perhaps the most common apparently healthy variation is apparent interruption for a couple of years just after attainment of an early sign of initiation. For instance, some girls may seem to develop stage 2 breast buds at 6 or 7 years of age with no other signs of puberty, and nothing may happen for 2 or 3 years. Physicians refer to this as ""unsustained puberty.""



Variations of sequence.



The sequence of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary. For example, in about 15% of boys and girls, pubarche (the first pubic hairs) can precede, respectively, gonadarche and thelarche by a few months. Rarely, menarche can occur before other signs of puberty in a few girls. These variations deserve medical evaluation because they can occasionally signal a disease.



Conclusion of puberty.

In a general sense, the conclusion of puberty is reproductive maturity. Criteria for defining the conclusion may differ for different purposes: attainment of the ability to reproduce, achievement of maximal adult height, maximal gonadal size, or adult sex hormone levels. Maximal adult height is achieved at an average age of 14.5 years for American girls and 17.5 years for American boys. Potential fertility (sometimes termed nubility) usually precedes completion of growth by 1-2 years in girls and 3-4 years in boys. Stage 5 in the tables above typically represents maximal gonadal growth and attainment of adult hormone levels.



Puberty as a neurohormonal process.



The endocrine reproductive system consists of the hypothalamus, the pituitary, the gonads, and the adrenal glands, with input and regulation from many other body systems. True puberty is often termed ""central puberty"" because it begins as a process of the central nervous system. A simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows:



The brain's hypothalamus begins to release pulses of GnRH. ;

Cells in the anterior pituitary respond by secreting LH and FSH into the circulation.

The ovaries or testes respond to the rising amounts of LH and FSH by growing and beginning to produce estradiol and testosterone.

Rising levels of estradiol and testosterone produce the body changes of female and male puberty.



The onset of this neurohormonal process may precede the first visible body changes by 1-2 years.



Components of the endocrine reproductive system.



The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is the driver of the reproductive system. It has neurons which generate and release pulses of GnRH into the portal venous system of the pituitary gland. The arcuate nucleus is affected and controlled by neuronal input from other areas of the brain and hormonal input from the gonads, adipose tissue and a variety of other systems. 



The pituitary gland responds to the pulsed GnRH signals by releasing LH and FSH into the blood of the general circulation, also in a pulsatile pattern.



The gonads (testes and ovaries) respond to rising levels of LH and FSH by producing the steroid sex hormones, testosterone and estradiol.



The adrenal glands are a second source for steroid hormones.  Adrenal maturation, termed adrenarche, typically precedes gonadarche in mid-childhood.



Major hormones of puberty.

GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) is a peptide hormone released from the hypothalamus which stimulates gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary.

LH (luteinizing hormone) is a larger protein hormone secreted into the general circulation by gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. The main target cells of LH are the Leydig cells of testes and the theca cells of the ovaries. LH secretion changes more dramatically with the initiation of puberty than FSH, as LH levels increase about 25-fold with the onset of puberty, compared with the 2.5-fold increase of FSH.

FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) is another protein hormone secreted into the general circulation by the gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary. The main target cells of FSH are the ovarian follicles and the Sertoli cells and spermatogenic tissue of the testes.

Testosterone is a steroid hormone produced primarily by the Leydig cells of the testes, and in lesser amounts by the theca cells of the ovaries and the adrenal cortex. Testosterone is the primary  mammalian androgen and the ""original"" anabolic steroid. It acts on androgen receptors in responsive tissue throughout the body. ;

Estradiol is a steroid hormone produced by aromatization of testosterone. Estradiol is the principal human estrogen and acts on estrogen receptors throughout the body. The largest amounts of estradiol are produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries, but lesser amounts are derived from testicular and adrenal testoterone.

Adrenal androgens are steroids produced by the zona reticulosa of the adrenal cortex in both sexes. The major adrenal androgens are dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione (which are precursors of testosterone), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate which is present in large amounts in the blood. Adrenal androgens contribute to the androgenic events of early puberty in girls. ;

IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) rises substantially during puberty in response to rising levels of growth hormone and may be the principal mediator of the pubertal growth spurt.

Leptin is a protein hormone produced by adipose tissue. Its primary target organ is the hypothalamus. The leptin level seems to provide the brain a rough indicator of adipose mass for purposes of regulation of appetite and energy metabolism. It also plays a permissive role in female puberty, which usually will not proceed until an adequate body mass has been achieved.



The process of puberty from an endocrine perspective.



The endocrine reproductive system becomes functional by the end of the first trimester of fetal life. The testes and ovaries become briefly inactive around the time of birth but resume hormonal activity until several months after birth, when incompletely understood mechanisms in the brain begin to suppress the activity of the arcuate nucleus. This has been referred to as maturation of the prepubertal ""gonadostat,"" which becomes sensitive to negative feedback by sex steroids. 



Gonadotropin and sex steroid levels fall to low levels (nearly undetectable by current clinical assays) for approximately another 8 to 10 years of childhood. Evidence is accumulating that the reproductive system is not totally inactive during the childhood years. Subtle increases in gonadotropin pulses occur, and ovarian follicles surrounding germ cells (future eggs) double in number.



Normal puberty is initiated in the hypothalamus, with de-inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus. This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an ongoing active suppression by other areas of the brain. The signal and mechanism releasing the arcuate nucleus from inhibition have been the subject of investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood. Leptin levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the arcuate nucleus to resume operation. If the childhood inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain, it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age. 



Neurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) into the blood of the pituitary portal system. These GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH (and to a lesser degree, FSH) at roughly 1-2 hour intervals. In the years preceding physical puberty, these gonadotropin pulses occur primarily at night and are of very low amplitude, but as puberty approaches they can be detected during the day. By the end of puberty, there is little day-night difference in the amplitude and frequency of gonadotropin pulses.



An array of ""autoamplification processes"" increase the production of all of the pubertal hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads.



Regulation of adrenarche and its relationship to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding  central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal androgens (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty. Adrenal androgens contribute to the development of pubic hair (pubarche), adult body odor, and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.



Hormonal changes of puberty in girls.



As the amplitude of LH pulses increases, the theca cells of the ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of progesterone. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called granulosa cells. Smaller increases of FSH induce an increase in the aromatase activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation.



Rising levels of estradiol produce the characteristic estrogenic body changes of female puberty: growth spurt, acceleration of bone maturation and closure, breast growth, increased fat composition, growth of the uterus, increased thickness of the endometrium and the vaginal mucosa, and widening of the lower pelvis.



As the estradiol levels gradually rise and the other autoamplification processes occur, a point of maturation is reached when the feedback sensitivity of the hypothalamic ""gonadostat"" becomes positive. This attainment of positive feedback is the hallmark of female sexual maturity, as it allows the midcycle LH surge necessary for ovulation.



Levels of adrenal androgens and testosterone also increase during puberty, producing the typical androgenic changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hair as outlined above, body odor, acne.



Growth hormone levels rise steadily throughout puberty. IGF1 levels rise and then decline as puberty ends. Growth finishes and adult height is attained as the estradiol levels complete closure of the epiphyses.



Hormonal changes of puberty in boys.



Early stages of male hypothalamic maturation seem to be very similar to the early stages of female puberty, though occurring about 1-2 years later. 



LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to make testosterone and blood levels begin to rise. For much of puberty, nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime. Regularity of frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin pulses seems to be less necessary for progression of male than female puberty.



As the testosterone levels slowly rise, most of the effects are mediated through the androgen receptors by way of conversion to dihydrotestosterone in the target tissues (especially of the skin).



However, a significant portion of testosterone in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls. Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) in a large proportion of boys.



Historical shift in the onset of puberty.



The age at which puberty occurs has dropped significantly since the 1840s.  Researchers refer to this drop as the 'secular trend'. From 1840 through 1950, in each decade there was a drop of four months in the average age of menarche among Western European female samples.  In Norway, girls born in 1840 had their first menarche at average 17 years. In France in 1840 the average was 15.3 years. In England the 1840 average was 16.5 years for girls. In Japan the decline happened later and was then more rapid: from 1945 to 1975 in Japan there was a drop of 11 months per decade.



The most likely cause, as is generally accepted, is the increase of weight gain in the world's youth. Some scientists and researches hypothesize it may be caused by hormones and other additions in processed milk and meats.



Increasing frequency of early onset of puberty.

The onset of puberty is occuring two years earlier than usual, reaching stage two level, with greater frequency.     This is reducing the childhood period, and is adding a greater risk of childhood pregnancy.  Contributing factors include environmental estrogens, a sedentary lifestyle and obesity.  See precocious puberty for further discussion of the medical dynamics of this issue.
